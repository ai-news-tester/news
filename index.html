          <p>NeuralTrack

NeuralTrack is a lightweight logging tool for deep learning training, designed to track loss and gradient updates efficiently without slowing down the training process. It provides easy-to-use logging functionality and visualization tools to help monitor model performance.

Features

‚úÖ Minimal Overhead ‚Äì Asynchronous logging ensures training speed is not compromised.

‚úÖ Loss Tracking ‚Äì Logs individual loss components per epoch.

‚úÖ Gradient Tracking ‚Äì Captures gradient statistics (mean, median, max, min) for each layer.

‚úÖ Visualizations ‚Äì Generate loss and gradient plots with simple CLI commands.

Installation

Install NeuralTrack via pip:

pip install neuraltrack

Quickstart

1Ô∏è‚É£ Logging Loss

In your training loop, use the LossLogger to track loss values:

from neuraltrack.logging.loss_logger import LossLogger logger = LossLogger ( "loss_log.json" ) for epoch in range ( num_epochs ): logger . start_epoch () for batch in dataloader : output = Model ( input ) loss1 = loss1 ( output ) loss2 = loss2 ( input , output ) total_loss = loss1 + loss2 optimizer . zero_grad () total_loss . backward () optimizer . setp () loss_dict = { "total_loss" : total_loss , "loss1" : loss1 , "loss2" : loss2 } logger . add_batch_loss ( loss_dict ) logger . log_epoch_loss ( epoch )

2Ô∏è‚É£ Logging Gradients

Track gradient statistics every few epochs:

from neuraltrack.logging.gradient_logger import GradientLogger grad_logger = GradientLogger ( "gradient_log.json" , log_interval = 10 ) for epoch in range ( num_epochs ): for batch in dataloader : output = Model ( input ) loss1 = loss1 ( output ) loss2 = loss2 ( input , output ) total_loss = loss1 + loss2 optimizer . zero_grad () total_loss . backward () grad_logger . log_gradients ( epoch , model ) optimizer . step ()

CLI Usage for LossPlotter and GradientPlotter

3Ô∏è‚É£ Plotting Loss

You can execute the loss plotting functionality from the CLI by running the following command in the terminal:

neuraltrack-plot-loss --log_path path_to_loss_log.json --show_plot --save_dir output_directory

Arguments for LossPlotter:

--log_path : Path to the loss log JSON file (required).

: Path to the loss log JSON file (required). --show_plot : Optional flag to display the plot interactively (if this is passed, the plot will open in a window after saving it).

: Optional flag to display the plot interactively (if this is passed, the plot will open in a window after saving it). --save_dir : Directory where the plot will be saved (optional; defaults to LossPlots).

Example Usage:

neuraltrack-plot-loss --log_path loss_log.json --show_plot

This command will generate a loss plot from the data in loss_log.json and display it interactively.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Plotting Gradients

To generate gradient plots, you can use the following command in your terminal:

neuraltrack-plot-gradient --log_path path_to_gradient_log.json --epoch 5 --show_plot --chart_type line --include_bias

Arguments for GradientPlotter:

--log_path: Path to the gradient log JSON file (required).

--epoch : Specific epoch number to plot (optional; default is 1).

: Specific epoch number to plot (optional; default is 1). --show_plot : Optional flag to display the plot interactively (if this is passed, the plot will open in a window after saving it).

: Optional flag to display the plot interactively (if this is passed, the plot will open in a window after saving it). --chart_type : The type of chart to use. Can be either line or bar (optional; default is line).

: The type of chart to use. Can be either line or bar (optional; default is line). --include_bias : Flag to include bias layers in the plot (optional; default is False).

Example Usage:

neuraltrack-plot-gradient --log_path gradient_log.json --epoch 5 --show_plot --chart_type bar --include_bias

This will generate a bar chart for the gradient values of epoch 5 and display the plot interactively.

Python Code Usage

Both LossPlotter and GradientPlotter can also be used directly within Python scripts.

LossPlotter Example (Python)

from neuraltrack.visualization.loss_plot import LossPlotter # Initialize LossPlotter with the path to the log file and save directory plotter = LossPlotter ( log_path = "loss_log.json" , save_dir = "LossPlots" ) # Plot the losses (optionally show the plot) plotter . plot_losses ( show_plot = True )

log_path : The path to your loss log JSON file.

: The path to your loss log JSON file. save_dir : The directory where the plot should be saved (optional; defaults to LossPlots).

: The directory where the plot should be saved (optional; defaults to LossPlots). show_plot : If set to True, the plot will be shown interactively after it is generated.

GradientPlotter Example (Python)

from neuraltrack.visualization.gradient_plot import GradientPlotter # Initialize GradientPlotter with your preferred arguments plotter = GradientPlotter ( log_path = "gradient_log.json" , save_dir = "GradientPlots" , chart_type = "line" , include_bias = False ) # Plot gradients for epoch 5 plotter . plot_gradients ( show_plot = True , epoch = 5 )

log_path : Path to your gradient log JSON file.

          <p>Close to 12,000 valid secrets that include API keys and passwords have been found in the Common Crawl dataset used for training multiple artificial intelligence models.

The Common Crawl non-profit organization maintains a massive open-source repository of petabytes of web data collected since 2008 and is free for anyone to use.

Because of the large dataset, many artificial intelligence projects may rely, at least in part, on the digital archive for training large language models (LLMs), including ones from OpenAI, DeepSeek, Google, Meta, Anthropic, and Stability.

AWS root keys and MailChimp API keys

Researchers at Truffle Security - the company behind the TruffleHog open-source scanner for sensitive data, found valid secrets after checking 400 terabytes of data from 2.67 billion web pages in the Common Crawl December 2024 archive.

They discovered 11,908 secrets that authenticate successfully, which developers hardcoded, indicating the potential of LLMs being trained on insecure code.

It should be noted that LLM training data is not used in raw form and goes through a pre-processing stage that involves cleaning and filtering out unnecessary content like irrelevant data, duplicate, harmful, or sensitive information.

Despite such efforts, it is difficult to remove confidential data, and the process offers no guarantee for stripping such a large dataset of all personally identifiable information (PII), financial data, medical records, and other sensitive content.

After analyzing the scanned data, Truffle Security found valid API keys for Amazon Web Services (AWS), MailChimp, and WalkScore services.

Overall, TruffleHog identified 219 distinct secret types in the Common Crawl dataset, the most common being MailChimp API keys.

‚ÄúNearly 1,500 unique Mailchimp API keys were hard coded in front-end HTML and JavaScript‚Äù - Truffle Security

The researchers explain that the developers‚Äô mistake was to hardcode them into HTML forms and JavaScript snippets and did not use server-side environment variables.

An attacker could use these keys for malicious activity such as phishing campaigns and brand impersonation. Furthermore, leaking such secrets could lead to data exfiltration.

Another highlight in the report is the high reuse rate of the discovered secrets, saying that 63% were present on multiple pages. One of them though, a WalkScore API key, ‚Äúappeared 57,029 times across 1,871 subdomains.‚Äù

The researchers also found one webpage with 17 unique live Slack webhooks, which should be kept secret because they allow apps to post messages into Slack.

‚ÄúKeep it secret, keep it safe. Your webhook URL contains a secret. Don't share it online, including via public version control repositories,‚Äù Slack warns.

Following the research, Truffle Security contacted impacted vendors and worked with them to revoke their users' keys. ‚ÄúWe successfully helped those organizations collectively rotate/revoke several thousand keys,‚Äù the researchers say.

Even if an artificial intelligence model uses older archives than the dataset the researchers scanned, Truffle Security's findings serve as a warning that insecure coding practices could influence the behavior of the LLM.</p>
