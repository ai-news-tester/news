As geopolitical tensions rise, the U.S. Department of Defense is expanding its integration of artificial intelligence to stay ahead and turning to AI agents to simulate confrontations with foreign adversaries.

On Wednesday, the Defense Innovation Unit, a Department of Defense organization, awarded a prototype contract to San Francisco-based Scale AI to build Thunderforge, an AI platform designed to enhance battlefield decision-making.

“[Thunderforge] will be the flagship program within the DoD for AI-based military planning and operations,” Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang said Wednesday on X.

Launched in 2016 by Wang and Lucy Guo, Scale AI helps speed up development by providing labeled data and the infrastructure needed to train AI models.

To develop Thunderforge, Scale AI will work with Microsoft, Google, and American defense contractor Anduril Industries, Wang said.

Thunderforge will initially be deployed to the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, which operates in the Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, and parts of Asia, and the U.S. European Command, which oversees Europe, the Middle East, the Arctic, and the Atlantic Ocean.

Thunderforge will support campaign strategy, resource allocation, and strategic assessments, according to a statement on Wednesday.

"Thunderforge brings AI-powered analysis and automation to operational and strategic planning, allowing decision-makers to operate at the pace required for emerging conflicts," DIU Thunderforge Program Lead Bryce Goodman said in the statement.

AI-focused or “Agentic Warfare” represents a shift from traditional warfare, where experts manually coordinate scenarios and make decisions over days, to an AI-driven model where decisions can be made in minutes.

Ensuring AI performs reliably in real-world defense applications is particularly challenging, especially when faced with unpredictable scenarios and ethical considerations.

“These AIs are trained on collected historical data and simulated data, which may not cover all the possible situations in the real world,” Professor of Computer Science at USC Sean Ren told Decrypt. “Additionally, defense operations are high-stakes use cases, so we need the AI to understand human values and make ethical decisions, which is still under active research.”

Challenges and safeguards

As the founder of Los Angeles-based decentralized AI developer Sahara AI, Ren said building realistic AI-driven wargaming simulations comes with significant challenges in accuracy and adaptability.

"I think two key aspects make this possible: collecting a large amount of real-world data for reference when building wargaming simulations and incorporating various constraints from both physical and human aspects," he said.

To create adaptive and strategic AI for wargaming simulations, Ren said it’s crucial to use training methods that allow the system to learn from experience and refine its decision-making over time.

“Reinforcement learning is a model training technique that can learn from the ‘outcome/feedback’ of a series of actions,” he said.

“In wargaming simulations, the AI can take exploratory actions and look for positive or negative outcomes from the simulated environment,” he added. “Depending on how comprehensive the simulated environment is, this is helpful for the AI to explore various situations exhaustively.”

With the expanding role of AI in military strategy, the Pentagon is forming more deals with private AI companies such as Scale AI to strengthen its capabilities.

While the idea of AI used by militaries may conjure images of “The Terminator,” military AI developers like San Diego-based Kratos Defense say that fear is unfounded.

"In the military context, we’re mostly seeing highly advanced autonomy and elements of classical machine learning, where machines aid in decision-making, but this does not typically involve decisions to release weapons," Kratos Defense President of Unmanned Systems Division, Steve Finley, previously told Decrypt. “AI substantially accelerates data collection and analysis to form decisions and conclusions."

One of the biggest concerns when discussing the integration of AI into military operations is ensuring that human oversight remains a fundamental part of decision-making, especially in high-stakes scenarios.

“If a weapon is involved or a maneuver risks human life, a human decision-maker is always in the loop,” Finley said. “There's always a safeguard—a 'stop' or 'hold'—for any weapon release or critical maneuver."

          <p>Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president at Amazon Web Services, speaks during the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai on Aug. 29, 2019 in Shanghai, China.

Amazon's cloud group is establishing a unit that will build software for working with artificial intelligence agents as the company aims to keep pace with competitors in generative AI.

Swami Sivasubramanian, an Amazon vice president who has been at the company for about two decades, announced the plans in a Wednesday LinkedIn post.

"Agentic systems offer possibilities that extend far beyond today's chatbots and will drive efficiency like we haven't seen before," wrote Sivasubramanian, who most recently was in charge of Amazon Web Services' database, analytics and AI services. "They will orchestrate complex workflows and solve problems with human-like reasoning, while maximizing performance and cost effectiveness at scale."

On Tuesday, Reuters reported that AWS CEO Matt Garman called agentic AI a potential multibillion-dollar business for AWS, in a memo about the new group.

Customers have begun adopting agent software through AWS. Amazon is also a big user internally. For example, the company's programmers have begun directing AWS' Q developer service to write or update source code.

Sivasubramanian said Amazon has "saved 4,500 developer years using Amazon Q Developer's code transformation capability to upgrade Java applications."

In November, Microsoft announced an Azure AI Agent Service, and two months later Microsoft-backed OpenAI started allowing paying users try its agent software called Operator. In December, Google said it would provide limited access to its Agentspace tool for a select set of customers.

Amazon leads the cloud infrastructure market, with nearly $29 billion in AWS revenue in the fourth quarter, well ahead of Microsoft and Google .

Amazon has started promoting a next-generation version of its Alexa voice assistant that will be able to use AI models from AWS and from Anthropic, which is backed by Amazon. Anthropic is handling the most advanced elements of the new Alexa+, CNBC reported last week, though an Amazon spokesperson called the information "false."

Several existing teams will move to the new organization, which will include vice presidents Asa Kalavade, Dilip Kumar and Deepak Singh, Sivasubramanian wrote in a Tuesday memo to his colleagues.

"Our focus will be on developing AI agents that are not just powerful and efficient, but also trustworthy and responsible," he wrote.
