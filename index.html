          <p>The latest proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) in the telecommunications industry has landed in Indonesia, with Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison (Indosat) announcing what it calls a “landmark” initiative to deploy an AI-based radio access network (RAN) infrastructure across the country.

Indosat, which is regarded as a frontrunner in AI-driven comms, has the stated vision to become the preferred digital telecommunications company in Indonesia. Together with its subsidiaries and affiliates, Indosat provides cellular services, ICT solutions, datacentres and fibre-to-the-home (FTTH), electronic payment services, financial services and other digital services.

The AI-RAN announcement sees it become the first operator in Southeast Asia and the third globally to build a commercial AI-RAN network, enabling the convergence of AI and wireless connectivity to enhance performance and efficiency, and unlock new opportunities across industries.

This initiative aligns with Indonesia’s national AI strategy, positioning Indosat as both a connectivity provider and an AI service enabler. Indosat has built a sovereign AI factory in Indonesia to enable enterprises, startups and government entities to create local AI applications across healthcare, education and agriculture. With the new AI-RAN infrastructure, the company plans to serve AI inferencing needs and supercharge the AI ecosystem for more than 277 million people.

The project is being made possible by working with Nokia and Nvidia with the parties having entered into an memorandum of understanding to develop, test and deploy the AI-RAN solution, with an initial focus on bringing AI inferencing workloads on Nvidia AI Aerial, followed by the integration of RAN workloads on the same platform. The integration also brings together Nokia’s 5G Cloud RAN solution and the Nvidia AI Aerial platform to create a unified accelerated computing infrastructure for hosting AI and RAN workloads.

The deployment will follow a phased approach, starting with the establishment of a 5G AI-RAN lab in Surabaya in early 2025 for joint development, testing and validation. A small-scale commercial pilot of AI inferencing workloads running on Nvidia AI-RAN infrastructure is planned in the second half of 2025. Further expansion of this solution deployment will happen in 2026.

As part of this initiative, Indosat, Nokia and Nvidia will work with leading Indonesian universities and research institutions to drive AI-RAN development. This collaboration will also support academic programmes to boost AI innovation in comms applications and provide hands-on opportunities for students and researchers to contribute to next-generation AI-powered networks. By engaging with academia, the companies are looking to accelerate breakthroughs in AI-driven network optimisation, spectral efficiency and energy consumption.

Indosat will use the Nvidia AI Enterprise software platform and serverless application programming interfaces (APIs) to enable optimised inferencing for an array of applications and AI workload distribution across central and distributed infrastructure, and allow the operator to bring AI capabilities to every application. The serverless API capabilities, built with Nvidia, will enable Indosat AI application partners – including Hippocratic.ai, Personal.ai, GoTo and Accenture – to use distributed inference engines to provide AI tokens at scale ensuring a more consistent experience.

Ultimately, the tech firms believe the approach they take will enable Indosat to revolutionise its network capabilities and business model, and that by sharing infrastructure costs across multiple applications, Indosat can maximise its return on investment while unlocking new revenue streams through a wide range of AI-driven services. Moreover, they are confident the deployment will achieve transformative gains in network performance, spectral efficiency and energy consumption, setting the stage for a software-driven 6G upgrade.

Commenting on the project and what he believes the operator can gain, Vikram Sinha, president director and CEO of Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison, said: “This collaboration marks a transformative milestone for Indonesia’s telecommunications industry. By embedding AI into our radio access network, we’re not just enhancing connectivity – we’re building a nationwide AI-powered ecosystem that will fuel innovation across industries. This aligns seamlessly with our mission to connect and empower every Indonesian.”</p>

          <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer a distant promise; it’s here, reshaping industries and challenging conventional approaches. For B2B marketing leaders, this is a pivotal moment demanding not just adaptation but proactive transformation. As a CMO, you’re at the forefront of this revolution, orchestrating changes that will define your organization’s success in an AI-enabled future. Here are some critical considerations for visionary marketing leaders to plan for now.

Redefining Marketing Teams With AI Ops

AI is more than a tool; it’s a catalyst for change. Marketing teams must evolve with savvy AIOps capabilities — agile, data-centric and technologically adept. This transformation involves equipping teams with AI literacy to effectively leverage AI tools, fostering cross-functional collaboration between marketing, IT and data science.

Redefining roles by integrating developers and technologists to build AI solutions tailored to your business needs will help breakdown siloes. This isn’t just about technology; it’s about reimagining marketing’s core operations.

Cultivating An AI-First Mindset

An AI-first mindset embeds data-driven decision-making, innovation and learning into your organization’s DNA. CMOs can foster this culture through leading by example, championing AI adoption and demonstrating its value. Promoting experimentation by encouraging teams to explore and test AI applications without fear of failure is another key step.

Additionally, investing in training and providing accessible learning resources helps employees at all levels understand AI’s role in their work. Building this culture takes time but is critical for future competitiveness.

Balancing Automation With Human Creativity

AI automates tasks, analyzes data and generates content, but it cannot replace human creativity, empathy or strategic thinking. Effective strategies use AI to free up time for high-value creative work, leverage AI insights to enhance campaigns, and maintain a human touch in customer interactions. The goal is not to replace humans but to augment their capabilities with AI’s power.

Creating Agentic AI Solutions In-House

Future marketing teams will need to develop agentic AI solutions — AI systems acting autonomously within defined parameters. This requires hiring developers and technologists who understand your specific needs, creating tailored solutions aligned with your brand and goals and continuously optimizing AI models to keep pace with evolving market dynamics. Agentic AI enables faster innovation, better adaptation and greater control, giving marketing teams a significant competitive advantage.

Bringing It All Together

AI is transforming every aspect of B2B marketing, from team structures and culture to the balance between automation and creativity. By embracing AI literacy, fostering an innovation-driven mindset and building in-house capabilities, CMOs can position their organizations for sustained success in an increasingly AI-driven world. The time to act is now — to lead, adapt and shape the future of marketing with AI at the core.

          <p>A producer for the Oscar-winning film, "The Brutalist," is defending the production’s use of artificial intelligence.

D.J. Gugenheim, one of several producers involved in the film, spoke with Deadline at the Oscars on Sunday night, saying the technology is simply a tool.

"If you’re in post [-production] on a film, there’s so many tools that you use, whether it’s lighting, sound, and these are all versions of functions of numbers," he told the outlet.

"What’s important about how we’re making a film is that we’re trusting the actors and the creatives and the talent to make a film. So, if no one is losing a job, and you’re making the best version of the product, that’s when you’re using a tool."

WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?

"The problem, I think, with AI is when we take away a job," he added.

Gugenheim said he felt the team didn’t hide the fact they used AI, noting the editor shared the information himself.

Dávid Jancsó told tech magazine Red Shark News in January that AI tools from Respeecher, a Ukrainian software company, were used to improve the Hungarian dialogue spoken by stars Adrien Brody, who won for best actor at this year’s Oscars, and Felicity Jones.

"I am a native Hungarian speaker and I know that it is one of the most difficult languages to learn to pronounce," Jancsó told Red Shark. "It’s an extremely unique language. We coached [Brody and Jones] and they did a fabulous job, but we also wanted to perfect it so that not even locals will spot any difference."

According to Jancsó, Brody and Jones recorded their voices into the AI software, and he used his own voice for some of the dialect.

He also shared that generative AI was used in the film’s final sequence to create a "series of architectural drawings and finished buildings" in the style of Brody’s character, an architect.

The revelation stirred controversy about the use of AI in film, and some demanded that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences institute disclosure rules for next year.

"People are asking questions, like, The Academy is now asking if AI is being used. I say that’s great. There’s no problem with that, and you shouldn’t use AI to take away from a job, for sure," Guggenheim told Deadline.

‘WICKED’ STAR ARIANA GRANDE FINDS AI ‘TROUBLESOME’ AFTER FAN-EDITED POSTERS CAUSE CONTROVERSY

Director Brady Corbet also addressed the controversy in a statement to Variety shortly after Jancsó’s interview, writing, "Adrien and Felicity’s performances are completely their own. They worked for months with dialect coach Tanera Marshall to perfect their accents. Innovative Respeecher technology was used in Hungarian language dialogue editing only, specifically to refine certain vowels and letters for accuracy. No English language was changed. This was a manual process, done by our sound team and Respeecher in post-production. The aim was to preserve the authenticity of Adrien and Felicity’s performances in another language, not to replace or alter them and done with the utmost respect for the craft."

Corbet also stated that production designer Judy Becker "and her team did not use AI to create or render any of the buildings. All images were hand-drawn by artists. To clarify, in the memorial video featured in the background of a shot, our editorial team created pictures intentionally designed to look like poor digital renderings circa 1980."

"The Brutalist" wasn’t the only nominated film this year to use AI.

"Emilia Perez" used AI to increase the vocal range of the film’s star, Karla Sofia Gascon, according to the re-recording mixer Cyril Holtz in an interview at Cannes last May, per The Guardian.

"Dune: Part Two" used AI for the Fremen characters, who have distinct glowing blue eyes.

In the official production notes for the film, Visual Effects Supervisor Paul Lambert explained they created "a machine-learning model, an algorithm trained from those ‘Dune’ shots to find human eyes in an image, which would then give us a matte for the different parts of the eye."
