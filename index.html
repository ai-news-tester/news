from the nice-try dept

We really need to stop pointing to Artificial Intelligence as some panacea, with all the world’s problems one well-constructed AI prompt away from resolution. That’s especially true when those same problems have much more simple and accessible answers. The preservation of video games has been a hobbyhorse of mine for some time, one which can be very frustrating when simple solutions are there for the taking, but nobody wants to take it. Want to preserve a video game? Release its source code after the main selling window and let the public do it. Boom, it’s preserved.

While that is just now starting to become a trend, it isn’t a road well-traveled by the industry for a variety of reasons. One of the main reasons is a combination of adherence to the religion of intellectual property combined with the fear that a dollar might be left on the table somewhere. And that can lead to really silly suggestions, such as Xbox’s Phil Spencer opining that perhaps AI can figure this whole preservation thing out.

Xbox has unveiled its generative AI project Muse, a “generative AI model of a video game that can generate game visuals, controller actions, or both.” The publisher is not being specific about this model’s exact uses, but has outlined some potential applications in its announcement. One of those proposed uses is game preservation. “Today, countless classic games tied to aging hardware are no longer playable by most people,” Xbox says in its announcement post. “Thanks to this breakthrough, we are exploring the potential for Muse to take older back catalog games from our studios and optimize them for any device. We believe this could radically change how we preserve and experience classic games in the future and make them accessible to more players.” “One of the things we care a lot about at Xbox is game preservation,” Phil Spencer says in a video accompanying the announcement. “And I think about an opportunity to have models learn about older games, games that were maybe tied to unique pieces of hardware where that engine on that hardware… Time will erode the amount of hardware that’s out there that can actually play a game.”

Alright, let’s stipulate that something is better than nothing. The idea that an AI-created facsimile of a game is better than that game simply disappearing entirely, unfindable in any format, seems immune to a counterpunch. On the other hand, nobody in their right mind would consider this the same as video game preservation. A print of the Mona Lisa is not preserving the Mona Lisa, never mind some AI image generator’s interpretation of the same.

And I’m not the only one pointing this out.

“I actually do think an AI model could observe and replicate game logic,” Video Game History Foundation founder Frank Cifaldi says on Bluesky, “and that might even be a useful tool for development! But this is like saying a photocopy of a painting is ‘preservation.’ It’s misleading and an insult to the thankless work we archivists do. I’m offended and sickened by this.” VGHF library director Phil Salvador puts it even more simply: “Generative AI video is a great way to preserve video games, in the sense that mirages are a great source of water.”

Instead, this harkens back to one of the main reasons gaming companies refuse to release their source code to the public. You will notice that, unlike that simple method, Spencer’s plan would allow Microsoft to retain both the full copyrights to any game in question while also providing an easier method for sales on modern hardware. In fact, it would be interesting to hear from Spencer whether he believes these updated versions of games created by AI would get their own separate copyright term. If so, then the preservation claim is simply a lie.

All of this also highlights the simple fact that Spencer is essentially admitting they aren’t doing video game preservation currently because it just takes too much time and energy. If the AI can do it quickly and cheaply, he’s all for it. But if it can’t? Culture can just disappear, apparently.

So, no, sorry, we aren’t going to solve preservation in the gaming industry by throwing AI at it. Unless we simply want to pretend that the word “preservation” means something it currently doesn’t.
