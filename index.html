          <p>Kroger saw growth in digital sales, employees’ use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools and the benefits of personalization during its fourth quarter, which ended Feb. 1, executives said Thursday (March 6) during the grocery giant’s quarterly earnings call.

The company saw 11% growth in digital sales during the fourth quarter, outpacing its 2.4% growth in overall identical sales, according to a Thursday earnings release.

For the full year of its fiscal 2024, digital sales accounted for $13 billion of Kroger’s total company sales of $147.1 billion, per the release.

“We are encouraged by our fourth quarter results, which delivered the best digital profit improvement quarter we’ve seen yet,” Kroger Interim Chief Financial Officer Todd Foley said Thursday during the company’s quarterly earnings call.

Foley added that digital is an “important growth accelerator” for Kroger because the company has found that digital households are more loyal and spend nearly three times as much as non-digitally engaged households.

AI tools are an important part of Kroger’s productivity initiatives, and the company added two such tools in 2024, Foley said during the call.

One is an AI-powered tool that uses real-time sales and shipment data to help associates manage inventory, while the other is an AI-powered virtual assistant for associates that provides personalized service for things like onboarding, training and human resources (HR) interactions.

“Today, almost 70,000 associates engage with this tool for more than 70 use cases,” Foley said during the call.

Kroger also made gains in its personalization efforts in 2024. The company delivered a 10% increase in digital coupon savings for its customers and enhanced its Boost membership benefits by adding Disney streaming options, according to an earnings presentation released Thursday.

“Offering fresh, high-quality products with personalized offers through a unique, seamless shopping experience led to strong customer engagement trends, including growth in both households and loyalty,” Foley said during the call.

Looking ahead, Kroger expects to see identical sales without fuel grow 2% to 3% in 2025, according to the earnings release.

“We delivered solid results in 2024, and our performance improved throughout the year,” Chairman and CEO Ron Sargent said during the call. “Looking to 2025, we have aggressive plans to build more stores and improve our share results, attract new households, and increase loyalty, which will accelerate growth and create shareholder value.”

Sargent delivered these remarks three days after being appointed to serve as chairman and interim CEO after the Monday (March 3) resignation of previous chairman and CEO Rodney McMullen. Prior to that, Sargent was the company’s lead director.

During the call, Sargent said the board has formed a search committee and begun the search process for a new CEO.

“But I think most importantly, we’re focused on identifying the right leader to drive Kroger’s growth and enhance shareholder value,” Sargent said.</p>

          <p>Meta is reportedly planning a major expansion of its AI offerings for business users.

The company’s artificial intelligence (AI) is being used by more than 700 million customers, and Meta hopes to offer it to “hundreds of millions” of businesses, Clara Shih, the tech giant’s head of business AI, said in an interview with CNBC Thursday (March 6).

“Not every business, especially small businesses, has the ability to hire these large AI teams, and so now we’re building business AIs for these small businesses so that even they can benefit from all of this innovation that’s happening,” Shih said.

“We’re quickly coming to a place where every business, from the very large to the very small, they’re going to have a business agent representing it and acting on its behalf, in its voice — the way that businesses today have websites and email addresses.”

Although major companies are investing millions in AI models, the 200 small businesses using Meta’s social media platforms don’t have that luxury, added Shih.

“They’re using WhatsApp, they’re using Facebook, they’re using Instagram, both to acquire customers, but also engage and deepen each of those relationships,” she said.

“Very soon, each of those businesses are going to have these AIs that can represent them and help automate redundant tasks, help speak in their voice, help them find more customers and provide almost like a concierge service to every single one of their customers, 24/7.”

PYMNTS examined the role AI agents play in retail last month in an interview with Keith Kirkpatrick, research director of enterprise applications at The Futurum Group. He said that in time, AI agents will affect some retail job functions, but that most of those tasks are digital and not physical.

“As such, many of these functions are still marketing- or commerce-based, and retailers will be looking to companies in adjacent industries to see how well AI agents from Salesforce, Microsoft, and others are delivering value to their customers,” said Kirkpatrick.

He added that the most important question is whether retailers will make the investment in technology that is still relatively new and in many ways, hasn’t demonstrated ROI.

“Margins are thin, and I think there will need to be fairly significant ROI examples that are directly relevant to retailers, in order to drive early adoption. I think pricing will be important, and AI agent pricing will need to be tied to specific metrics or outcomes,” he said.

          <p>Executives at Yum! Brands and Taco Bell this week showcased their "Byte by Yum" artificial intelligence-powered tools for restaurant managers, disclosing at an investor event that it has invested US$1 billion ($1.58 billion) into digital and technology.

Use of AI is "already beginning around labor and inventory," said Dane Mathews, Taco Bell's chief digital and technology officer, at the event.

To demonstrate its current and planned use of AI technology, chief operating officer Jason Kidd showed Wall Street analysts a video skit with a restaurant manager talking to a human character playing the role of an AI assistant, which Yum calls Byte AI Restaurant Coach.

"I noticed Brad hasn't clocked in yet for his shift, and you're heading into your last shift crew for the night," an actor playing the AI assistant says, addressing the Taco Bell manager.

"Maybe he's out sick. Don't worry if he is. I can work the drive-through," the AI character tells the manager.

About 500 Taco Bell US locations have AI voice technology to take drive-through orders, according to a slide that the executives showed following the skit.

That is up from the roughly 100 locations that Yum cited in July 2024.

One analyst, from Morgan Stanley, called Yum's video skit "very cool and slightly unsettling."

Yum's chief technology officer, Joe Park, said Taco Bell does not plan to use AI to reduce its labor costs, but rather to free up its employees to do other tasks.

'Long road ahead'

Fast food corporations are increasingly turning to tech to overhaul a business model that until recently had remained the same since the 1940s.

The last decade or so has seen a proliferation of kiosks, digital menus, apps, AI-assisted drive-throughs, and loyalty programs.

Chipotle's US$100 million venture fund has helped spur its efforts to partially automate its kitchens.

McDonald's announced in 2023 a partnership with Google Cloud to in part deploy AI tech to its locations, though that backfired for a day in 2024 when system outages made ordering impossible in some of its largest markets.

At Yum, Mathews said there is "still a long road ahead of us."

Nearly 25,000 of Yum's 61,000 restaurants globally use one of its in-house "Byte by Yum" tech products, Yum said in a February 6 statement.

In the Taco Bell skit, the character playing the manager's AI-assistant computes that a worker has been scheduled for fewer than her usual weekly hours, and prods the manager to "see if she wants to stick around the next hour" to reduce customer wait times.

Also noting that a "competitor down the street" reduced its hours of operation, the AI assistant suggested that the manager expand his own restaurant's hours, citing a surge in late night sales.

The AI assistant offered to help the manager calculate inventory. "Awesome, that's a real time-saver," the manager says in the skit.

A Yum spokeswoman did not immediately reply to a request for comment on whether AI is currently performing these tasks at any Taco Bell locations, or if the skit only showed its future ambitions.

Yum disclosed a projected eight percent increase in Taco Bell same store sales in the current quarter.

Yum's in-house software suite "really excited us," Bernstein analysts who attended the event said in a note for investors.

Yum could potentially one day sell the software "outside the Yum ecosystem," they said.</p>
