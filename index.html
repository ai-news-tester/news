What one Finnish church learned from creating a service almost entirely with AI

HELSINKI -- A tale of good versus evil played out on the large screen in the sanctuary of St. Paul’s Lutheran church in Finland. Jesus was shown in robes with long hair and a beard, while Satan was dressed in more modern clothes but with a menacing frown and higher-pitched voice — all created by artificial intelligence.

Also addressing the flock at the Tuesday evening service were avatars of the church’s pastors and a former president of Finland who died in 1986, reading from the Old Testament.

It was the first church service in Finland put together mostly by AI tools, which wrote the sermons and some of the songs, composed the music and created the visuals.

The widely advertised experimental service drew over 120 people to the church in northeastern Helsinki, much more than on a typical weeknight. People came from out of town as did a handful of foreigners who admitted they didn’t speak Finnish well enough to understand it all.

“Usually when people talk about AI, they are talking about what AI can do in the future. But the future is now. … AI can do all those things that people think that it can maybe do in 10 years or so,” said the Rev. Petja Kopperoinen, who came up with the idea and brought it to fruition.

The clergy and worshippers said they enjoyed it, but agreed it wouldn't replace services led by humans anytime soon.

“It was pretty entertaining and fun, but it didn’t feel like a Mass or a service. … It felt distant. I didn’t feel like they were talking to me,” Taru Nieminen told The Associated Press.

The Rev. Kari Kanala, the vicar at St. Paul's, echoed her sentiment.

“The warmth of the people is what people need,” he said.

Churches and pastors around the world have been experimenting with AI, just like the rest of the society, to try to understand what role it could play in their lives — and if it can attract more worshippers.

In 2023, an AI-led service was held in a church in Germany. Last year, an avatar of “Jesus” on a computer screen in a Catholic chapel in Switzerland took questions from believers and offered responses based on Scripture.

St. Paul’s church likes to try new things, with pastors incorporating screenings of soccer and ice hockey matches into their services, along with dance and film festivals.

After attending a conference on AI and religion in Geneva and hearing about the service in Germany, Kopperoinen says he thought: Why not try it?

Kanala was on board, as was Bishop Teemu Laajasalo of Helsinki.

Kopperoinen worked for weeks with different AI tools to assemble the 45-minute service, including Open AI’s ChatGPT-4o to write the words, except for those from the Bible; Suno to compose the tunes, similar to pop music; and the Synthesia AI platform to create video avatars of himself, Kanala and another pastor from existing footage.

Seeing himself onscreen speaking words he never said in real life felt “eerie,” Kopperoinen said.

Another tool, Akool, meanwhile, created the avatar of former Finnish President Urho Kekkonen reading from the Old Testament, and the exchange between Satan and Jesus.

In between AI-produced elements, clergy and worshippers sang hymns with live organ music.

The exercise had clear limits. AI was not involved in forgiving sins at the Helsinki service, and the Eucharist was not performed.

Any output needs to be fact-checked and edited by a human, and AI copy is often based on stereotypes, Kopperoinen said.

AI tools generally seemed reluctant to compose religious content, he said. ChatGPT initially wouldn't write dialogue between Jesus and Satan and went along with it only after Kopperoinen assured it that he was a Lutheran pastor and there was nothing wrong with writing it.

ChatGPT also refused to give absolution or blessings, which is a good guardrail, Kanala said, "because somehow it can divide things which are very intimate and religious.”

Kopperoinen also said he was aware of the impact of AI tools on the environment, including, for example, the amount of water used to power them. Some in the Finnish Lutheran church criticized St. Paul's for using AI to entertain people at the cost of the environment, he said.

Worshippers said they found the service different, interesting and entertaining, but also confusing at times. Speech patterns were rapid and hard to follow.

“I did like the songs. They were really catchy, although they lacked the kind of soul the humans have," said student Jeera Pulkkinen, who disliked the tools' fast delivery of the text.

Eeva Salonen, chief development officer at the Helsinki Parish Union, said the service felt “more like a performance,” finding it more impersonal than “it would be with real people.”

"But I really liked it,” she added.

The need for a human element is one of the reasons AI is unlikely to replace real pastors, Kopperoinen said.

“It can’t be empathetic towards people. AI can’t really answer your questions in a spiritual way,” he said.

Still, both Kopperoinen and Kanala believe there is a place in the church for AI. St. Paul's already uses it for bookkeeping, and Kopperoinen sometimes turns to ChatGPT to help him compose sermons or when he needs to find verses on a particular topic.

Kanala admits he has "always opposed” AI, but decided to confront it head-on and now thinks it can help clergy on things like research for sermons and speeches.

Tom Stoneham, a University of York philosophy professor and an ethicist with the Center for Doctoral Training in Safe AI Systems in the U.K., notes AI can replace humans only “where the function of the human is purely instrumental” and transactional, such as “in customer service situations."

Even in these situations, however, a smile or a brief friendly exchange adds value that AI can’t, Stoneham said.

In a religious setting, “it’s about the human, not an instrument. They’re not just a mere means to achieving something," he said. "It’s that humanity that is adding value to the situation.”

Anna Puzio, a researcher on ethics of technology at the University of Twente in the Netherlands, said that given the concerns with AI, it’s important for churches and religious groups to experiment with it. That way they can help “shape these AI processes and develop AI and design it in a responsible way,” she said.

Philippine MSMEs embrace AI: A game changer for efficiency and growth as the government pushes for integration of the technology in business operations

MANILA, Philippines – The artificial intelligence (AI) wave is in the Philippines and it is expected to increase its influence over the operations of businesses and governments worldwide.

In the Philippines, micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) have started investing in AI just as the government has jumpstarted integrating it into its services.

Truelogic, a 15-year-old digital marketing firm based in the Philippines, in its report based on its managing partner, listed prosthetics company Instalim, logistics and delivery firm Mober, and credit scoring company Finscore among the companies that have started adopting the technology into its operations.

Truelogic CEO Itamar Gero, citing his company’s own experience integrating AI, said those choosing to adopt the technology early took into account how it can help in removing inefficiencies and reducing “mindless” work.

“MSMEs don’t have this big, big amount of data, they don’t have the big amounts of budgets to do it, but where they can start [with AI] is in the grassroots, in the employees,” Gero said in an interview with Rappler.

Truelogic handles the digital marketing of several Philippine companies. For the marketing firm, AI helps cut downtime on operations, expedite research, and streamline feedback mechanisms.

Gero said any local MSME handling customer data in marketing and research could also benefit from the technology as it afforded its employees more time to do high-level work.

“[AI] gets people to do more brain work versus, you know, waiting [for] work. What it brings about is the workforce needing to be a lot more exhaustive of their kind of high-end work versus mindless work like researching, looking at facts, copy-pasting,” he said.

Gero said Truelogic planned to continue its investments in the technology.

“Part of our processes, we do have AI; we are working on investing in our own AI tools [for] market insight, market research, because we realized there is not enough for the Filipino market to identify gaps in the market,” he said in an interview with Rappler.

“AI has streamlined anything around research, content strategies, social media strategies,” he added.

Philippine outlook on AI

On April 30, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr directed the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) to make local MSMEs AI-ready, setting the tone for how the country will adopt AI technology four years after it became broadly accessible to the public through OpenAI’s ChatGPT-3 and image generating Dall-E 2.

The DTI expects that with AI, as much as $92 billion could be contributed to the country’s economy within 7 years.

The DTI also launched a new “Center for AI Research” in July.

The growing AI interest in the Philippines reflects emerging trends abroad.

While still in the early implementation phase of their AI-related initiatives, six Southeast Asian nations have already joined the Philippines in releasing their own national AI framework. These countries include Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.

Prior to the launch of text and image-generating platforms, consultation firm Kearney already projected that AI would generate about $1 trillion for the Southeast Asian economy by 2030.

Japan-based Ana Arriola-Kanada, co-director of IDEO Tokyo and a specialist on AI and machine learning, said optimism on the impact of AI in businesses reflects global interests, given its ability to augment the operational capacities of MSMEs.

“I think the excitement is going to be in the small- and medium-sized businesses, I think it’s going to be fun to see how these little, tiny companies are going to innovate using this new technology,” she told Rappler.

“Smaller companies are probably using G Suite and Gemini; if you think about the medium-sized businesses, then they are the ones that are more likely to make the investment into more of a smaller enterprise-type solution, like the Microsoft Dynamics 365,” she said.

“So there’s a major uptick right now, you can think of it like the current state of the industry as being a movie that we all want to watch that we all waited to be released, and now the movie is being released, and we’re starting to see what the adventure is all about, what the possibilities are,” she said.

Local SMEs must adopt, adapt

According to Microsoft and LinkedIn’s “2024 Work Trend Index on AI Use at Work in the Philippines”: “86% of Filipino knowledge workers use AI at work, higher than the global average of 75% and regional average of 83%.”

Given the growing interest among both businesses and employees, Arriola-Kanada is optimistic that MSMEs will begin integrating AI to maximize its benefits, especially given the risk of job displacements in some industries if they are unable to adapt.

“I don’t think it’s taking over their job functions, I think it’s [going to] help them. They’re [going to] be able to spend more time on their product, making their product, being with their customers, building new business, doing more sales, and not having to worry about back office related stuff, so I think it’s a positive thing,” she said.

However, Arriola-Kanada pointed out that job displacements may still be possible in engineering and programming if companies in the two industries fail to adapt to the changing landscape.

Truelogic’s Gero, meanwhile, said industries have always been able to adopt emerging technologies throughout history.

“I do think [we have] this kind of self-healing property of our culture; it will not leave people behind, even if it takes a year or two, even if it [takes] changing the curriculum. This is where we have to act, the curriculum, the grassroots,” he said.

Gero pointed out that for instance, the business process outsourcing (BPO) industry should start looking at how it can use and maximize the new technology in business. As AI voice agents continue to improve, displacement within the industry remains possible. (READ: Will IT-BPM workers and students survive without AI skills?)

“So the BPO needs to look at what assets that the BPO environment here has, and try to leverage that. Try to not fight with AI, but support AI, support AI companies, support AI models, just bring AI closer to home,” the Truelogic founder said.

He noted how Truelogic adopted the technology, giving the company room for growth due to more streamlined operations and added capacity for handling data with the aid of AI.

Gero added that it is essential for MSMEs to start experimenting with AI to remain competitive.

Meanwhile, Arriola-Kanada still puts emphasis that company growth is driven by management and employees themselves. Success is not reliant on AI.

Both Gero and Arriola-Kanada mentioned limiting the influence of AI in generative image programs, to check fraud and abuses.

“If they [SMEs] stay upskilled and they continue to have that radically youthful growth mindset where they’re constantly curious about how things are changing and how to use the changes and learn how to work with the changes, they’ll be fine, they’ll be fine 20 years from now,” she said.

“It’s the people who become complacent and just use ChatGPT as it is now, asking basic questions, and they don’t do the hard work of learning where agents are going, those are the ones [who] will be displaced.” – with a report from Fernando Pierre Marcel B. dela Cruz/Rappler.com
