          <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile, White House Artificial Intelligence and Crypto Czar David Sacks said in a Thursday (March 6) post on X.

The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve will be capitalized with bitcoin seized in criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings and owned by the federal government, so it “will not cost taxpayers a dime,” Sacks said in the post.

The executive order also calls for a full accounting of the federal government’s digital asset holdings, Sacks said, adding that there has never been such an audit and that it is estimated that the government owns about 200,000 bitcoin.

Bitcoin deposited into the reserve will not be sold. Instead, it will be kept as a store of value serving like a “digital Fort Knox” for bitcoin, Sacks said.

“Premature sales of bitcoin have already cost U.S. taxpayers over $17 billion in lost value,” Sacks said in the post. “Now the federal government will have a strategy to maximize the value of its holdings.”

The executive order authorizes the secretaries of Treasury and Commerce to develop “budget-neutral strategies” for acquiring additional bitcoin at no incremental cost to taxpayers.

The U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile established by the executive order will consist of digital assets other than bitcoin that have been forfeited in criminal or civil proceedings, Sacks said. Beyond that, the government will not acquire additional assets for the stockpile.

“The purpose of the Stockpile is responsible stewardship of the government’s digital assets under the Treasury Department,” Sacks said in the post.

Sacks added in the post: “This Executive Order underscores President Trump’s commitment to making the U.S. the ‘crypto capital of the world.’”

Trump said in a Jan. 23 executive order that a newly established Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets would, among other things, consider the creation of a “strategic national digital assets stockpile.”

On Sunday (March 2) Trump announced not just the creation of a U.S. strategic cryptocurrency reserve but also the digital assets it could be composed of: bitcoin, ethereum, XRP, Solana’s SOL coin and Cardano’s ADA.</p>

Preferred Networks is a little-known name outside of Japan, but the Toyota-backed artificial intelligence unicorn has big plans to use deep learning to fix "real-world" issues — with the end goal of going global.

"For the past 10 years, we have been working on using AI to solve real-world problems," chief executive researcher, Daisuke Okanohara, told CNBC's "Managing Asia." The company has ventured into industries as varied as trucking, health care and robots.

Preferred Networks has drawn the attention of big names such as automotive giant Toyota , which in 2017 invested 10.5 billion yen ($95.4 million) in the company on top of an initial 1 billion yen in 2015.

Preferred Networks is one of the few unicorns in Japan. Though Japan's startup ecosystem has grown, Japanese companies valued at over $1 billion make up just 0.5% of the world's total, according to an International Monetary Fund working paper published in December.

The deep-learning startup is also in a joint venture with trading house Mitsui & Co. in the field of autonomous driving. The two have invested in a company, T2, in order to address challenges associated with the trucking industry, including "extremely long" working hours that stretch into the night and a declining pool of drivers, said CEO Toru Nishikawa.

But competition in the car industry was also a factor. Acknowledging the company's current limitations, Okanohara added, "If we were to tackle the problem of regular cars, it would be extremely difficult. There are many companies working on autonomous driving, and it is a very competitive field."

Preferred Networks' AI ambitions have since gone much further afield. But compared with other AI solutions in the digital space, in which it is "relatively easy to achieve results with users," dealing with real-world problems requires more time, Okanohara said.

When asked how long it takes for the company's technologies to start making money, Nishikawa said it could take as many as five years in a field like AI-based materials discovery.

"First, we start joint research with companies and then assess whether or not it can be commercialized. Once we determine that it can be commercialized, we work to create services and products that can be provided to customers," he said, adding that "in total, this process takes about three to five years before commercialization and practical launch."

As for the latest AI developments, Okanohara said that Preferred Networks had recognized DeepSeek's "very good technology" and "paid close attention to it" before it was catapulted to fame, adding that "various players" will soon enter the chip industry.

Preferred Networks is hoping to be among them. Recognizing that Nvidia's generative AI strategy has fared well thus far but has a graphics processing unit design that is not yet "optimal," Nishikawa said Preferred Networks is in the midst of "creating more advanced processors" to gain a competitive advantage.</p>
