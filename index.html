China announced on Sunday that it would accelerate the use of artificial intelligence and big data in elderly and social care, betting on new technologies to drive economic growth despite an ageing population.

The announcement comes as officials struggle with the country’s low birth rate and a declining workforce.

“We will accelerate the development and application of new technologies and products such as big data and artificial intelligence in the fields of social assistance, elderly care services, and services for the disabled,” Civil Affairs Minister Lu Zhiyuan said at a news conference during China’s annual Two Sessions political gathering.

The move aims to make services “more convenient, more accessible, and more standardised,” Lu said.

China’s population declined for the third consecutive year in 2024, with more than 310 million people aged 60 and over.

As the workforce shrinks, the government is increasingly turning to technology to drive future economic growth.

Local governments have rushed to integrate DeepSeek’s AI model into their services since the privately run Chinese company released the latest version of its chatbot in January.

DeepSeek’s budget-friendly model has outperformed many of its Western AI competitors, despite US restrictions on the sale of advanced AI chips to Chinese firms.

President Xi Jinping reaffirmed official support for the sector last month when he hosted a rare symposium for private companies, attended by several AI and technology executives. He urged them to “show their talents.”

DeepSeek’s founder, Liang Wenfeng, was present at the meeting, along with representatives from leading technology firms such as Tencent, Huawei, and Xiaomi.

          <p>An artificial intelligence (AI)-based altcoin and a decentralized finance (DeFi) token have soared in price after being added to Coinbase’s listing roadmap.

In a post on the social media platform X, Coinbase Assets announces the additions of AI-focused project Aethir (ATH) and DeFi protocol Maple Finance (SYRUP) to its listing roadmap, causing the digital assets to spike in price.

Coinbase’s listing roadmap is typically used for transparency and to prevent the front-running of tokens prior to them being listed. Being added to the roadmap means the crypto exchange may add support for the crypto asset soon.

News of the addition sent both tokens flying, as ATH went from a low of $0.0318 on March 6th to a peak of $0.0435 just a day later, a gain of about 36.79%.

Meanwhile, SYRUP went form a low of $0.137 on March 7th to a peak of $0.193 on March 8th, a rise of 40%.

Both assets have since retraced and are valued at $0.0371 and $0.165, respectively.

Aethir, which launched over Ethereum (ETH) in June 2024, is a decentralized cloud computing protocol that is focused on offering high-performance graphics processing unit (GPU) capabilities to AI as well as blockchain-based video games.

Maple Finance, which launched in 2021, is a borrowing and lending protocol that allows borrowers to access capital by providing under-collateralized loans and enables lenders to earn yields by providing liquidity.

          <p>Immunai, a leading artificial intelligence (AI) biotech company specializing in immune system mapping, has appointed Mikael Dolsten, M.D., Ph.D., to its Board of Directors. Dolsten, who served as Pfizer’s chief scientific officer and president of research and development for 15 years, will support Immunai’s efforts to integrate AI into immunology and oncology research.

During his tenure at Pfizer, Dolsten oversaw research across all therapeutic areas, leading a team of thousands of scientists. His contributions resulted in more than 35 drug and vaccine approvals, including the first mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine. His work has also shaped treatments for rheumatoid arthritis, stroke prevention, and cancer.

“Pharma continues turning to AI to better understand diseases and speed up drug discovery and development,” said Noam Solomon, Ph.D., CEO and co-founder of Immunai.

“But moving from data to real treatments takes deep expertise. Mikael has spent decades leading drug development at the highest level, and his experience will help us apply AI in ways that drive real progress.” People pose with syringe with needle in front of displayed Pfizer logo in this illustration taken.

Advancing AI in drug discovery

Before joining Pfizer in 2009, Dolsten held senior leadership roles at Wyeth, Boehringer Ingelheim, and AstraZeneca, where he played a pivotal role in drug discovery across multiple therapeutic areas. Over the course of his career, he has helped select around 200 drug candidates, advancing up to 50 regulatory approvals.

“Immunai’s AI model of the immune system is reshaping how we approach therapeutic discovery and development,” Dolsten said.

“Having previously collaborated with Immunai, I’ve seen firsthand how their AI and immunomics capabilities can enhance drug development efficiency and success rates. By leveraging AI to analyze immune responses at single-cell resolution, we can accelerate the development of innovative treatments and bring them to patients faster.”

Dolsten’s appointment follows Immunai’s recent multi-year collaborations with AstraZeneca and Teva Pharmaceuticals, which highlight the increasing role of AI-driven insights in clinical development. Immunai’s proprietary immune cell atlas, AMICA™, and Immunodynamics Engine (IDE)™ are being used to optimize dose selection, biomarker discovery, and patient response predictions.</p>
