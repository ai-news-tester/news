          <p>WhatsApp for Android might soon get a redesigned Meta AI interface. As per the new leak, the instant messaging platform is making several changes to the way users access and use the artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot. The new interface is said to offer an automatic voice mode, and it comes with prompt suggestions to help users get started. These new features are said to be under development, and not available to beta testers. Notably, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently stated that Meta AI will be significantly upgraded in 2025.

WhatsApp Might Be Working on Meta AI Redesign

According to WhatsApp feature tracker WABetaInfo, the messaging platform is working on enhancing the Meta AI experience for users. The new interface of the chatbot was spotted with the latest WhatsApp beta for Android 2.25.5.22 update. However, since it is under-development, beta testers will not be able to try it out at this time.

Based on screenshots shared by the feature tracker, the Meta AI icon located at the bottom-right corner of WhatsApp's chats screen can now be long pressed to open Meta AI in a new interface and trigger the voice mode.

The new Meta AI interface is not like the existing chat window, instead a large part of the screen is occupied by the chatbot's logo and the word “listening” underneath. Users can begin to converse with the AI or to ask it a question. Android also shows the green microphone icon in the status bar to highlight that the interface is accessing the device's microphone.

As per the feature tracker, users can seamlessly switch to the text mode by tapping the microphone button or by typing something in the text field. Meta AI is said to listen to users only till they are in this interface. If they exit the window, the session is said to end. The new interface also adds prompt suggestions that are aimed at users to get inspiration from.

This new interface is said to be rolled out to users in a future update. However, it is unclear when that might be. Notably, WhatsApp has not officially announced this Meta AI redesign.</p>

          <p>Digg founder Kevin Rose has teamed up with former rival Alexis Ohanian to buy the once-popular content aggregator as they bet on an artificial intelligence-powered revival of the platform that once drew around 40 million monthly visitors.

Launched in 2004 by a then 27-year-old Rose, Digg was once called the "homepage of the internet" and was a rival to Reddit, a firm co-founded by Ohanian.

But the platform lost ground after its 2012 sale to New York-based tech incubator Betaworks. Microsoft's LinkedIn scooped up its most valuable assets, including patents. It has since pivoted to curating news.

Rose and Ohanian, who acquired Digg for an undisclosed sum, said on Wednesday they aim to revive the platform by leveraging their social media expertise, restoring its nostalgic early interface.

Digg's early model allowed users to "digg" or "bury" content— an early precursor to how social media platforms surface viral stories today.

The duo also plans to use AI-driven curation to curb misinformation and toxic discourse.

"Recently we've hit an inflection point where AI can become a helpful co-pilot to users and moderators, not replacing human conversation, but rather augmenting it," Rose said.

He added that he had been approached several times over the past years to buy Digg but it "never felt right" before.

Invites for the new version will roll out in the coming weeks, as Digg prepares to reenter a crowded social media landscape where smaller players such as Pinterest are jostling for ad dollars and user attention with giants such as Meta.

Justin Mezzell, a longtime collaborator of Rose with experience at Google and Facebook, will take over as Digg CEO.

The deal is backed by venture capital firms True Ventures, where Rose is a partner, and Ohanian's Seven Seven Six. Rose will be Digg's board chair and key advisor.

Ohanian has also joined a bid led by former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt to acquire TikTok's U.S. operations.</p>

          <p>As an eager learner but total newcomer to artificial intelligence, I'm excited to try out any new AI tool or product I come across and provide you with honest feedback about whether it's worth your time and money. But I knew I wanted to dig deeper into what AI is, where it came from and how to integrate the software into my day-to-day life in practical ways.

After seeing targeted advertising (I assume because of my AI-related internet searches), I gave in and watched MasterClass's three-part Achieve More with GenAI series to educate myself on AI beyond the companies and platforms that promote and sell its capabilities to the masses.

I wanted to learn from experts in the field in a digestible, concise format, and I was introduced to Ethan Mollick, Allie K. Miller, Don Allen Stevenson III and Manuel Sansily, who virtually taught me how AI can navigate work and the world to unlock productivity and unleash creativity, in support of ethics and the future.

How much does MasterClass AI cost?

A MasterClass subscription costs between $120 and $240 per year, but there is a 30-day money-back guarantee included with membership.

If another monthly bill doesn't seem economical, two-week guest passes pop up in chat threads, which can give you more opportunities to try the learning and education platform without commitment.

Unlock your productivity with genAI

Miller and Mollick (who pop in throughout each episode) kicked off the series with history and context of AI -- did you know it was first explored in the 1950s? -- and the ways that it can be an asset for work. Mollick used the example of AI for improving writing from conception to feedback -- which as someone watching the series to then write about it felt supportive yet slightly ironic.

Miller led us through how to use AI to develop a business plan: 1. Brainstorm; 2. Evaluation; 3. Enhance Your Idea; 4. Bringing it to Life; and 5. Using AI for Feedback.

I have used AI for feedback on issues in my personal life but hadn't considered using it for professional purposes. But when Miller introduced me to Yoodli, an AI-powered communication coach, to illustrate how AI can provide feedback, analytics and tips on your work, and Mollick shared real-time feedback from AI-powered assistant Claude on his presentation, I considered the possibility.

The first episode of the GenAI series taught me that AI can be incredibly helpful for understanding, organizing and regurgitating information into different contexts -- and there are countless AI-powered tools that support the same approach when working in a particular medium or needing specific feedback or help.

Unleash your creativity with genAI

Next, I received a thorough breakdown of AI prompting techniques, AI-assisted business planning and AI for visual design. The second class in the series was led by Stevenson, a creative technologist fascinated by the fusion of art and technology.

Stevenson defined and demonstrated how to use AI set around communication and clarity for business planning, logo design, storyboard creation and music generation, using Dall-E, an image generator, and Udio, an AI music generator.

A throughline in Stevenson's messaging was how to use AI as a collaborator and how the conversation between you and your large language model can help produce better results.

By the end of the class, I had created imagery using Stevenson's guidance to draft a concept I've been toying with for the past couple of weeks. By delegating to ChatGPT, I learned how challenging it is to get something out of your brain and into words that will guide someone else.

While I wasn't as efficient as Stevenson in building out a brand identity kit (in less than 5 minutes), I did churn out color schemes, images and typography that pleasantly surprised me and inspired me to keep creating for my brand.

Ethics and the future of genAI

In the last episode I met Sansily, a futurist and advocate for the responsible use of AI, who shares how to automate and optimize routine tasks with the help of an "AI twin" creation. (This requires ChatGPT's $20 per month Plus plan.)

An AI twin is a digital creation based on your knowledge, work experience and values. Similar to ChatGPT, it stores memory and continues to learn you and your habits the more you interact with it. Once created, your AI twin -- which looks eerily similar to a Memoji -- can act as your personal assistant or a digital tool that others can interact with and use.

Sansily shares how a digital representation of the custom ChatGPT brain allows you to input information to guide the GPT's "brain" through a seven-step system, including designing your twin and giving it context, instructions and values. You then test, publish and monitor your AI twin, which can be instrumental in tracking your own growth, as well as sharing it with others and downloading it for use.

To close the series out, Mollick shared four scenarios around AI and its potential. He challenges humans to look at positive examples of AI related to Amara's Law -- where humans underestimate change in the short term and overestimate change in the long term. Is the fear valid or based on a lack of understanding?

For me, what was most fascinating was how overwhelmed I've been by AI's amazing abilities and where that's taking us. As a reporter and consumer, I have so much more to learn.

According to Mollick, AI's growth is doubling or tripling the pace of Moore's Law, the observation that the power of computers doubles every two years. In short: AI is moving faster than our brain's ability to respond. But not forever: At some point, he says, AI will settle into a more graspable pace of evolution.

In the meantime, I will be sifting through and learning every new AI-powered and GPT model available. Not to mention, using artificial intelligence to make my dreams of having a twin come true -- all in a matter of a few clicks.

Is MasterClass's GenAI series worth the money?

I tried MasterClass's GenAI series to better understand where AI is headed, and how it may affect my life. As a result, I have more knowledge to inform my decisions and opinions, rather than rely on others to make them for me.

This was my first MasterClass and I was impressed. From the camera quality to the experts' on-air personalities to how digestible the content was, I would recommend this series, especially to those afraid of AI, overwhelmed by its many uses or who have questions about what artificial intelligence means on its own and in the world with humans.

While you may consider yourself adept at all things tech, I'd advocate spending 90 minutes of your day on this series, if for no other reason than to brush up on artificial intelligence-specific definitions and metaphors.

At the most, you will gain an increase in awareness for how something with such rampant growth operates as a system, collaborator and -- in some scenarios -- a mentor, personal trainer and twin.</p>
