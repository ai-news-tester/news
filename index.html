          <p>Virginia could be the second U.S. state to enact artificial intelligence (AI) regulations targeting high risk AI systems, after Colorado, according to the National Law Review.

The Virginia State Senate recently passed the High-Risk Artificial Intelligence Developer and Deployer Act, which applies to AI systems that autonomously make decisions, or “significantly influence” them.

The legislation will affect companies that use these AI systems, including when hiring people. If the legislation is signed into law by Gov. Glenn Youngkin, it will take effect on July 1, 2026.

But Virginia’s AI regulations differ from Colorado’s in one key aspect: AI must constitute the “principal basis” for a decision to trigger anti-discrimination provisions of the law, according to the publication.

“This threshold requirement creates a higher bar for establishing coverage than Colorado’s ‘substantial factor’ standard,” the authors wrote.

The legislation focuses on safeguarding consumers from algorithmic discrimination in consequential decisions like those related to lending, housing, education, healthcare and employment.

However, even if the user of the AI tool did not mean to discriminate against consumers, the use of the tool alone means they are culpable.

Moreover, developers that use generative AI to create audio, video or images must make sure the content is clearly marked.

Deployers must inform consumers as well when AI is used in consequential decisions and provide opportunities to correct data or appeal decisions.

However, there are 19 types of technologies exempt from this act. These include anti-fraud technology without facial recognition, cybersecurity tools, anti-malware and anti-virus technologies.

Fines for unintentional violations go up to $1,000 per instance plus attorney’s fees and other costs. Willful violations carry a fine of up to $10,000 per instance. Each violation is counted separately, and penalties can skyrocket quickly if many people are affected.

Regulating AI’s Role in Layoffs in New York

The increased use of artificial intelligence has led to fear among employees that their jobs would be replaced by automation.

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul recently announced that she wants employers to disclose whether AI tools played a role in mass layoffs or office closures as they file their notices with the state Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act.

This is the first time a state has made this requirement, according to the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM).

Shawn Matthew Clark, a lawyer at Littler in New York City, told SHRM that this requirement is “one more content obligation that will need to be added to the many other complex notice requirements that already exist in New York WARN.”

New York’s WARN requires that employers with at least 50 employees issue a notice if they plan to lay off at least 25 full-time employees that account for at least a third of the workforce at a single location, or a total of 250 full-time employees. Federal WARN requires it of employers with 100 or more workers that are laying off at least 50 workers at a single location.

The proposal is part of a suite of AI initiatives Hochul has outlined.

New York will also provide AI training to small businesses, launch a public-private partnership with tech companies to invest $20 million into New York AI startups, and offer free training and placement of disadvantaged college students into AI jobs through a program called “AI Prep.”

Estonia to Bring AI Tools to All Schools

The government of Estonia has unveiled a national AI education program that will embed the technology throughout its educational system.

Called AI Leap 2025, the program will give students and teachers free access to the world’s leading AI applications, along with the appropriate training to use them effectively in learning. It goes into effect on Sept. 1.

“Artificial intelligence has permanently changed the world, and like all sectors, the education system must adapt to these changes,” said Estonian President Alar Karis in a statement. “It will help Estonia become the world’s smartest nation.”

The program will initially include 20,000 high school students in grades 10 to 11 and their 3,000 teachers. The plan is to expand the program to vocational schools and new students in 2026, adding another 38,000 students and 2,000 teachers to the pool.

Negotiations have begun with OpenAI and Anthropic, with plans to involve other AI companies as well.</p>

          <p>Wow! Not only has TDX given us the chance to connect, learn, build, and become Agentblazers together, but there have also been some game-changing announcements in the keynote for admins working with artificial intelligence (AI) in Salesforce.

This year’s keynote follows the story of an Agentforce customer redefining their customer experience with intelligent products and services. It also covers feature announcements you don’t want to miss.

Let’s dive into the top announcements from TDX, including both features available now and those coming soon to our Awesome Admins.

Transform every process and app

The keynote helped us clearly grasp the impact Agentforce has across an entire enterprise. As an admin, you can leverage the power of agentic AI to bring together all the products and integrations across your organization to deliver a deeply unified experience to users and customers.

Agent Builder Response Actions

Your home base for building agents, topics, and actions, Agent Builder is bringing exciting improvements to admins including Response Actions.

With Response Actions, agents can render rich messaging components such as rich links, images, carousels, and quick replies to provide a more engaging user experience.

You can also leverage Multi-Modal Actions in Agentforce so that customers and users can upload files, images, and documents to the agent. Agentforce will then be able to analyze the image and respond with an appropriate recommendation.

Embed Agentforce anywhere

Traditional agents respond to user input, but what if your organization wants to take the next step toward agents being truly autonomous and not just assistive?

Agent Invocable Actions leverage telemetry data to take action in real time without a user asking it to perform a task, and can be initiated from Flow, Apex, MuleSoft connector, and API. This means Agentforce can now run anywhere and be triggered by anything rather than be confined to a chat window or mobile app.

It’s easy to add an Agent Action directly in Flow.

Agentforce in Slack

If you’re not already familiar with Slack, now’s the time to explore this incredible tool where agents and employees get work done.

Agentforce in Slack provides a great builder experience for admins, where you can bring agents directly to your primary collaboration space.

Slack recently announced several Agentforce 2.0 enhancements that empower admins to bring agents into Slack to work directly with teams. Agents can create Slack channels, answer questions, and extend Agentforce with prebuilt Slack Actions. Not only that, but in Agent Builder there are Slack Actions you can add to your agent topics.

Build and deploy agents fast

You might be thinking, that is all great news for my users and customers, but what about my experience? Fear not, fellow admins—the TDX keynote also featured exciting updates for builders and Agentforce specialists, or should I say, Agentblazers.

Developer Edition

The announcement I am most excited about is that Agentforce Developer Edition is now available for you to do more building and testing!

Up until this point, we’ve used Trailhead playgrounds as a safe space to experiment and innovate (and yes, sometimes break things), or maybe your Salesforce instance includes Foundations. But now, admins everywhere can do more building and more testing in a whole new Developer Edition complete with Agentforce. Even better news: Data Cloud will be enabled in these orgs as well.

Sign up for your Developer Edition now.

AI Assist

Admins can create AI-generated topics, actions, and response feedback with AI Assist. AI Assist takes seamless agent creation a step further by now offering feedback on topic instructions and descriptions. This will help you work faster and more efficiently in Agentforce, and help scale building multiple agents for your organization.

Agent Templates

As the Product Owners of Salesforce, we like to maintain close control over everything built in our own Salesforce instance(s), including building agents. Whether you use AI Assist to help generate your agent or you use Agent Builder, building agents from scratch allows you to control every aspect of how your agent responds, surfaces, looks, and feels. You have the power to customize topics and actions to fit your exact use case.

DX Inspector

DX Inspector is a new management tool within sandboxes that enhances metadata tracking and visualization in an org. This is a great way for admins to better manage agents. The DX Inspector highlights changes made across the org: the Changes tab offers a unified view of all modifications across the org—an unprecedented feature. You can explore agents with the Metadata Explorer which provides a hierarchical view of agent metadata, including agents, topics, and actions, for deeper insights and streamlined management.

Testing Center

Although configuration is one of the most fun parts of our jobs as admins, our needs don’t stop there. We also need to test for accuracy and be able to trust that our agents perform the way we want them to before we feel comfortable deploying them.

With Agentforce, we are no longer just testing for Pass/Fail, but for trustworthiness and accuracy. Testing Center allows us to do this—testing autonomous agents at scale in the UI so that our organizations can roll out trusted agents in a secure, repeatable way. This is already available for you to use!

Take a look at our Agentforce Decoded video to learn how to use this in the UI.

Agentforce Interaction Explorer

As admins, we love our analytics and rely on reports and insights to help us continue to iterate and make Salesforce better for our users—both internal and external. Admins have been asking for more insight into their agent performance and behavior, and with Agentforce Interaction Explorer, this information is on its way!

Agentforce Interaction Explorer will provide a complete view of all agent interactions, performance metrics, and a historical record of conversations or moments. Admins can dig into specific agents for deeper insights into the prevalence of topics and resolutions the agent was able to provide. This is a great way to not only keep an eye on your agent but also identify any gaps in its topics and continue to iterate and make your agent better, to serve customers better.

With Analytics, you can also dive into a specific agent and check on its performance and sentiment. Detailed information on uptime, error rate, latency, and escalation will be at your fingertips to report to stakeholders and demonstrate the ROI of your agents. You can also dive into individual channels to get deep into performance reporting.

Extend Agentforce

As admins, we regularly use the AppExchange to extend Salesforce with custom applications, reports, and dashboards, giving us the ability to install apps in Salesforce the same way we would on our phones.

When you need to extend Agentforce, thus far you have been busy creating new custom actions using flows and the tools you are familiar with. But now you have another option—you can use the AgentExchange in the same manner you would use the AppExchange: to search Agentforce actions from ISV Partners and Agents created by others. This means that you can bring new pre-built actions and templates to your agents even faster. AgentExchange is the trusted agent marketplace built right into Salesforce, and you can access it from directly within the Agent Builder, right in the flow of your admin work.

Salesforce is all about being a community and as admins we support each other and share our innovation. So with AgentExchange you can now also share the agent actions and templates you have created with agent packaging.

Be an Agentblazer

Agentforce Virtual Hackathon

The keynote didn’t just bring us product announcements—we also announced exciting events for admins to continue their Agentblazer journey, like the Agentforce Virtual Hackathon.
