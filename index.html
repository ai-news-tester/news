          <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has entered the mainstream. We’re finding more and more products that integrate with the technology. WordPress plugins are a prime example.

These plugins add a variety of AI-powered features to websites. Some are there to spur creativity, while others are all about saving you time. The trend is helping to spawn new products and enhance existing ones.

AI is rapidly changing the WordPress ecosystem. So, we wanted to explore the different ways plugins are using it. Will they make our lives easier? Will they help users? Let’s find out!

Here’s a collection of WordPress plugins that, in one way or another, add artificial intelligence to your website. Some are longtime favorites, while others are upstarts breaking into the ecosystem. We hope you find them useful!

Rank Math is one of many SEO plugins that integrate AI into their product. The difference here is in the depth of the AI tools offered. There are options for generating entire blog posts, outlines, SEO titles and descriptions, fixing grammar mistakes, and more.

You’ll need a free account to access the various AI features. The benefit is making SEO easier for novices and experts alike. Generating various types of content provides a solid foundation. You’ll have more time to focus on other areas of your site.

Automattic’s do-it-all suite offers Jetpack AI Assistant, allowing you to generate various types of content. For example, the tool will generate a featured image for your blog post based on its content or a custom prompt.

In addition, it will help improve grammar, rewrite your content, or generate an entire page. There’s a free tier with 20 monthly requests, while paid plans offer higher limits.

Here’s an option that specifically targets WooCommerce stores. Kestrel AI is a commercial plugin that generates or optimizes product descriptions, replies to customer reviews, and adds order notes.

It places an icon on relevant areas of the screen. Click it, and the assistant will help you perform the noted tasks. The plugin works with OpenAI and includes placeholders that pull the correct product data.

Here’s proof that AI integrations don’t need to overwhelm users. OptinMonster is a plugin that creates popups and opt-in forms to generate leads. The plugin features a “smart optimization” tool that uses AI to improve the content of your popup. It doesn’t generate text for you. Rather, it seeks to improve what’s already there. It’s a subtle-but-helpful use case.

AI-powered chatbots are on the rise. They aim to answer user questions and help them find relevant content. WPBot uses services like ChatGPT and DialogFlow to provide a “live” chat with a virtual assistant.

The plugin’s pro version can also train AI on your website’s content, leading to better answers and more efficient resource usage. Other features include adding custom text responses, an option for users to contact you, and multi-language support.

AI Engine is a suite of tools for adding artificial intelligence to your WordPress website. Install the plugin, insert your OpenAI API key, and add features.

What sort of features? You can add a chatbot, generate images and text, translate content, and run various tasks inside WordPress. The plugin will also help you keep track of API usage, an important feature, as the costs can add up.

You can use Uncanny Automator to link all sorts of website activities together. For example, these “triggers” can send a customer a follow-up email a few days after they order a product. There are integrations with several popular plugins.

It also ties in with OpenAI, allowing for automated blog post summaries, social media posts, featured images, translations, and more. It’s a natural extension of what the plugin already does.

Categorizing and tagging content isn’t always easy. The goal is to create a logical structure for your content. That’s better for SEO and users. TaxoPress is a taxonomy management plugin that helps you create and manage that structure.

The pro version offers an AI integration (OpenAI, IBM Watson) that automatically creates and determines the best taxonomies for your content. It removes an often frustrating step from your content creation workflow.

AI Power is notable for its compatibility with several large language models (LLM). You can connect the plugin to OpenAI, DeepSeek, Claude, Gemini, Azure, and more. Choose your model and take advantage of an all-in-one collection of website tools.

You can optimize your site’s SEO, bulk-generate content, create a chatbot, use text-to-speech capabilities, or generate images. You can also train a model on your website’s content for a more personalized experience. There are free and pro versions available.

Sensei LMS is a plugin for building online courses. The pro version offers a few handy tools powered by AI. First, an auto Quiz Generator will create questions based on your course’s content. The second is a Tutor AI block available through the Sensei Interactive Blocks add-on.

It adds a chatbot that can answer user questions regarding your course content. The block isn’t limited to Sensei – it’s also compatible with other LMS plugins. It’s an example of how AI can improve the online learning experience.

Bring the Power of AI to Your Website

We’re still in the early days of AI. Thus, the plugins in this roundup are only scratching the surface of what may come down the road. Still, they offer both convenience and utility.

The key is finding options that fit your needs. You may notice that there is some overlap in what these plugins do. For instance, several plugins generate text and images. The odds are you don’t need more than one of these for your website.

With that, consider how you can use AI to improve your website. Perhaps you’re all about streamlining your workflow or improving the front end for users. There are good options here either way.

What will the future bring? It’s safe to say AI will have tighter integrations with WordPress and will be able to accomplish more useful tasks. We can’t wait to see what’s next!</p>

          <p>The Digital Ethics Centre at Delft University of Technology, Netherlands, has been designated as a WHO Collaborating Centre on artificial intelligence (AI) for health governance.

AI has the potential to re-shape healthcare, save lives and improve health and well-being. However, harnessing its benefits calls for collaboration from stakeholders committed to robust governance, ethical safeguards, and evidence-based policies, the World Health Organization (WHO) said.

The WHO Collaborating Centre designation recognises the Digital Ethics Centre at Delft University of Technology’s decades-long history of cutting-edge research on responsible innovation, and its leadership in incorporating ethical values into design requirements for digital technologies, it added.</p>
