          <p>KUALA LUMPUR: British chip giant Arm Holdings signed an agreement with Malaysia on Wednesday (Mar 5) to bolster the Southeast Asian country's efforts to produce high-end semiconductors amid the US-China tech trade war.

Malaysia is a key player in the vital chips sector but has been largely focused on packaging, assembly and testing services - the lower end of the market.

The agreement will see Softbank-owned Arm provide chip designs and other technology, helping Malaysia to move into more value-added production such as wafer fabrication and integrated circuit design.

The Southeast Asian nation is paying US$250 million over a decade to receive support from the British company, journalists were told at a briefing by Malaysia's economic ministry.

"Through a comprehensive partnership with Arm, we have conceived one of the most ambitious technological plans Malaysia has ever seen - to pioneer Made-by-Malaysia AI chips," Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said in remarks before witnessing the signing.

"These chips will be designed, manufactured, tested and assembled here, and sold to the rest of the world."

In addition, Arm will also establish its first office in Southeast Asia in Kuala Lumpur, aiming to expand the company's reach in the region as well as Australia and New Zealand, Anwar said.

"We won't let you down. This is going to be an extremely exciting 10 years and more," said Arm chief executive Rene Haas.</p>

          <p>Cohere For AI, the firm's open research division, released new state-of-the-art (SOTA) vision models on Tuesday. Dubbed Aya Vision, the artificial intelligence (AI) models are available in two parameter sizes. The company's latest frontier models address the inconsistent performance of existing large language models (LLMs) across different languages, especially for multimodal tasks. Aya Vision models can generate outputs in 23 languages and can perform both text-based and image-based tasks. However, it cannot generate images. Cohere has made the AI models available on open-source repositories as well as via WhatsApp.

Cohere Releases Aya Vision AI Models

In a blog post, the AI firm detailed the new vision models. Aya Vision is available in 8B and 32B parameter sizes. These models can generate text, translate text and images across 23 languages, analyse images and answer queries about them, as well as caption images. Both models can be accessed via Cohere's Hugging Face page and on Kaggle.

Additionally, general users can try out Cohere's models via a dedicated WhatsApp chat account that can be accessed here. The company says the Aya Vision models are useful for instances when people come across images or artworks they would like to learn more about.

Based on the company's internal testing, the Aya Vision 8B model outperforms Qwen2.5-VL 7B, Gemini Flash 1.5 8B, and Llama 3.2 11B Vision models on the AyaVisionBench and m-WildVision benchmarks. Notably, the AyaVisionBench benchmark was also developed by Cohere, and its details have been shared in the public domain.

Coming to the Aya Vision 32B model, the company claimed that it outperformed Llama 3.2 90B Vision and Qwen2-VL 72B models on the same benchmarks.

To achieve frontier performance, Cohere claimed that several algorithmic innovations were developed. The Aya Vision models were fed synthetic annotations, developers scaled up multilingual data through translation and rephrasing, and multiple multimodal models were merged in separate steps. The developers observed that in each step, the performance was significantly improved.

Notably, developers can access the open weights of the Aya Vision models from Kaggle and Hugging Face, however, these models are available with a Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial 4.0 license. It allows for academic and research-based usage but prohibits commercial use cases.</p>

          <p>HPS, a leading global provider of payment software and solutions, and Enigma, a global leader in artificial intelligence enabled entity resolution and decision-making, today announced a strategic collaboration to deliver cutting-edge AI fraud detection models to businesses worldwide.

0

This partnership combines Enigma’s advanced AI capabilities with HPS’s comprehensive payment platform, offering clients unprecedented security and efficiency in navigating the complexities of modern payment systems.



In an era where fraud methods are becoming increasingly sophisticated, with phishing, vishing, identity theft, and other forms of fraud, it is essential for financial institutions to have tools that adapt and respond to dynamic threats. This solution protects transactions while ensuring a smooth and frictionless experience for customers.



The strength of this system lies in the combination of two complementary approaches: on one hand, an advanced AI model that anticipates and detects emerging fraud patterns; on the other hand, a proven rule-based detection system that ensures effective identification of known suspicious behaviours. This synergy between AI and business rules provides optimal coverage against a wide range of threats, from the most sophisticated to the most common. In this powerful partnership, Enigma brings years of expertise in developing advanced machine learning models designed to detect and predict fraudulent activities with exceptional accuracy. These models analyse vast datasets, uncovering subtle anomalies that traditional rule-based systems may overlook.



Meanwhile, HPS, with its scalable and versatile payment platform operating in over 95 countries, provides the necessary infrastructure to seamlessly integrate Enigma’s AI capabilities into the business management of payments. This includes fraud prevention, detection, and mitigation mechanisms, covering both payment issuance and acquisition management, as well as authorisation management. This synergy ensures optimised protection for clients while maintaining smooth, uninterrupted operations across the globe.



Enigma has already gained the trust of several of the world’s largest financial and technology players. The company collaborates with over 50% of the Top 10 banks in the United States, a consortium of the largest American banks, as well as industry giants such as Chase Bank, PayPal, and Equifax. These references highlight the strength and effectiveness of the AI model applied to fraud prevention, now integrated into HPS’s payment platform.



“This partnership aligns perfectly with Enigma’s mission to make financial ecosystems safer and more intelligent through the power of AI and our global expansion,” said Hicham Oudghiri - CEO of Enigma. “Together with HPS, we’re setting a new benchmark for fraud prevention and compliance.”



“This alliance with Enigma represents a major leap forward in payment security, combining cutting-edge artificial intelligence with HPS’s world-class payment platform,” said Abdeslam Alaoui Smaili - CEO of HPS. “By leveraging AI-driven fraud detection, we’re able to offer businesses a truly innovative solution that not only anticipates and prevents fraud but also enhances the overall transaction experience. This is more than just a step forward in security; it’s a transformation in how businesses can confidently navigate the future of digital payments.”</p>

The Human Element: Overcoming the Resistance That Awaits New Ideas ($17.00 Value) FREE for a Limited Time Watch your most innovative ideas take flight by overcoming the forces that resist change. The Human Element/is for anyone who wants to introduce a new idea or innovation into the world. Most marketers, innovators, executives, activists, or anyone else in the business of creating change, operate on a deep assumption. It is the belief that the best (and perhaps only) way to convince people to embrace a new idea is to heighten the appeal of the idea itself. We instinctively believe that if we add enough value, people will eventually say “yes.” This reflex leads us down a path of adding features and benefits to our ideas or increasing the sizzle of our messaging – all in the hope of getting others on board. We call this instinct the “Fuel-based mindset.” The Fuel-based mindset explains so much of what we do, from adding countless trivial features to software, to bolting a sixth blade onto a shaving razor. By focusing on Fuel, innovators neglect the other half of the equation – the psychological Frictions that oppose change. Frictions create drag on innovation. And though they are rarely considered, overcoming these Frictions is essential for bringing new ideas into the world.The Human Elementhighlights the four Frictions that operate against innovation. Readers will discover: Why their best ideas and initiatives often get rejected – despite their undeniable value. How to disarm the forces of resistance that act against change. How to transform the very Frictions that hold us back into catalysts for change. Perfect for business leaders, product managers, educators, and anyone else who seeks to bring new and exciting ideas to life,The Human Elementis an indispensable resource to help people overcome the powerful forces of human nature that instinctively resist change.
