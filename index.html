          <p>With the announcement of the 2025 Pritzker Prize winner less than 24 hours away, Archinect has continued an experiment we began last year, asking four artificial intelligence models to predict the 2025 winner. Below, ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity have their say after (human) Archinect readers offered us their predictions last week.

Beyond the novelty of the experiment and curiosity over how accurate the results may turn out to be, eliciting predictions from AI models offers an opportunity to track the capabilities of such systems over time, including accuracy.

In 2024, the AI models we consulted struggled with providing a list free of previous winners or, in Gemini's case, not generating the requested number of potential names. This time, ChatGPT continued to offer previous winners, only generating a valid list on the third attempt. Gemini and Claude also provided previous winners on their first attempt. After a brief back-and-forth, however, all models returned ten potential winners and a single 'most likely' prediction. While several architects featured on two or more lists, Tatiana Bilbao was the only architect to be included in all four lists.

Below, we have set out the predictions and justifications offered by each model. Will any of the predictions come true? Find out tomorrow on Archinect at 9 am Eastern when the winner will be announced.

ChatGPT 4o

Most likely winner: Tatiana Bilbao

"Bilbao has the strongest case based on recent Pritzker trends favoring social impact, sustainability, and human-centered design. Her focus on affordable housing, gender inclusivity, and ecological responsibility aligns with past winners like Lacaton & Vassal (2021) and Francis Kéré (2022)."

Top ten contenders

Tatiana Bilbao (Mexico): "Bilbao’s work focuses on social housing, ecological responsibility, and a deep connection to place. Her ability to blend modernist principles with local traditions makes her a strong contender." Vo Trong Nghia (Vietnam): "A pioneer in sustainable architecture, Nghia’s bamboo structures and biophilic designs are redefining how architecture can coexist with nature." Winy Maas / MVRDV (Netherlands): "MVRDV challenges traditional urban design with bold, colorful, and experimental projects. If the jury wants to reward radical innovation, Maas is a strong candidate." Bijoy Jain / Studio Mumbai (India): "Jain merges traditional craftsmanship with modern design, creating poetic spaces that honor materials and artisanal construction." Elizabeth Diller & Ricardo Scofidio / Diller Scofidio + Renfro (USA): "DS+R is at the forefront of cultural and urban transformation, from the High Line to major museum projects.
