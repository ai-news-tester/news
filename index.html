          <p>STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY We followed a rigorous article screening and data extraction process to present a comprehensive analysis of the role of machine learning (ML) compared with conventional statistics (CS) in the prediction of postpartum haemorrhage (PPH).

An independent quality assessment was performed using a large language model (GPT-4) to analyse Prediction model risk of bias assessment tool for studies developing, validating or updating prediction model items.

The high variability across studies, stemming from differences in methodology, included subgroups, PPH definitions and predictors, may limit comparison among studies and increase heterogeneity.

Only two studies directly compared ML models to CS models, which points to the need for more comparative research.

Background According to the WHO, postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is responsible for more than a quarter of all maternal deaths worldwide. PPH is the leading cause of maternal mortality and accounts for more than 100 000 maternal deaths each year in developing countries.1 PPH can be defined as a blood loss (BL) greater than 500 mL after a vaginal delivery or than 1000 mL after a caesarean delivery or as any postpartum vaginal bleeding leading to haemodynamic instability.2 Its prevention could be achieved through identification of women at highest risk, allowing adherence to prophylactic measures to avoid maternal morbidity and mortality.3–5 Although traditional predictive methods have been consistently studied, their predictive results are not satisfactory. A significant portion of haemorrhages (up to 43%) occur in women deemed to be at low risk. Unfortunately, only 60% of women at high risk for PPH can be identified in advance.3–5 Risk factors for PPH have been established, including previous episodes of PPH, multiple gestation, pre-eclampsia, augmented labour, foetal macrosomia, operative vaginal delivery and complex lacerations, among others.6–9 Other individual risk factors for PPH were identified, but these do not reliably identify women at greatest risk by combining multiple risk factors. A combination of risk factors is common in clinical practice, but quantifying the associated risk without the aid of a clinical prediction model is challenging.10 Previous studies suggested that PPH can be predicted using both traditional statistical analyses and machine learning (ML) models.11 Artiﬁcial intelligence can generate rules and patterns based on the input and output data and has the advantage of processing non-additive relationships and incorporating complex interactions between factors that do not need to be pre-specified.11 ML approaches might accurately identify women at highest risk of PPH and improve obstetric decision-making and clinical outcomes. This systematic review aims to confirm whether PPH can be predicted with similar discriminative ability using both ML and conventional statistical (CS) models. An additional outcome is to describe the strongest risk factors of PPH identified by ML and traditional statistical models.

Methods Protocol and registry This review adhered to principles outlined in guidance published by Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis12 and Prediction model risk of bias assessment tool for studies developing, validating or updating prediction models (PROBAST).13 The protocol for this review has been registered in PROSPERO (ID CRD42024521059). Search strategy The literature search was conducted on 4 January 2024 in the following databases: PubMed (MEDLINE), LILACS-BVS, Cochrane Library, Scopus-Elsevier, Embase-Elsevier and Web of Science. The search was restricted to studies published in the last 10 years. A high sensitivity search strategy was developed with the assistance of an experienced librarian for each database, online supplemental table S1. Supplemental material [bmjopen-2024-094455supp001.pdf] Eligibility criteria We included studies that fit the following criteria: (1) assessed early PPH, independently of the definition followed; (2) evaluated PPH prediction; (3) applied accuracy metrics for outcomes evaluation; and (4) clinical trials or observational studies (cross-sectional, cohort, database analysis and case–control). We excluded studies that (1) did not classify excessive bleeding according to a widely accepted definition of PPH or studies that evaluated only severe PPH, excluding non-severe PPH, according to the definition used in which particular study. We included papers in all idioms with abstracts available in English. Study selection, data extraction and quality of studies evaluation We used the State of the Art software through Systematic Review14 to import articles, identify duplicates and select studies according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Titles and abstracts were independently screened by two reviewers, and any disagreements were resolved by a third reviewer. Data extraction was conducted independently by two reviewers. We assessed the risk of bias and applicability of each study according to PROBAST tools. The assessment was performed by a reviewer, followed by the use of the large language model (LLM) GPT-4 Open AI15 support to independently analyse PROBAST items. The GPT-4 analysis was conducted as reported by a prompt design developed by the authors. A senior reviewer resolved conflicts between human and machine judgments. The LLM prompt and evaluation criteria are available in the online supplemental tables S2 and S3. We evaluated CS models, ML approaches and accuracy metrics (sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values, Area under the Curve (AUC), F1, precision and recall and other accuracy rates) for PPH prediction. We considered a method as ML according to the author’s description. CS was considered as a method of conventional statistics (CS) using the entire database. The predictors used in the best model of each study were extracted and used to construct a word cloud. To allow for counting the frequency of predictors, terms with similar clinical meaning, such as age and maternal age, or neonatal weight and macrosomia, were homogenised. In these cases, we chose the most appropriate term to represent the predictor. Predictors from models whose studies did not mention them were not included. Statistical analysis ORs with 95% CIs were used to compare the odds of PPH prediction using ML models to the odds of PPH prediction using CS approaches when both approaches were evaluated in the same sample population. A pooled OR of 1 would suggest that there is no difference in the odds of predicting PPH between the two methods. The Cochran Q test and I2 statistics were used to assess for heterogeneity, with a p value less than 0.10 providing evidence of heterogeneity of intervention effects.16 We performed a random-effects meta-analysis to incorporate heterogeneity among studies. Review Manager V.5.4.1 (Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen, Denmark) was used for the meta-analysis.17 Patients and public involvement None.

Discussion PPH is one of the leading causes of maternal mortality worldwide, accounting for 27.1% and 16.3% of maternal deaths, respectively, in developing and developed regions.51 Nevertheless, the accurate prediction of PPH remains a challenge. The main strength of this systematic review is to present the first comprehensive analysis of the accuracy of ML compared with CS in the prediction of PPH. It was noted that PPH can be predicted using both methods, and the findings from this review supported the possibility of using ML models to enhance the accuracy of PPH prediction. No previous reviews were found to compare ML models and traditional statistical models for PPH prediction. Carr et al 52 conducted a systematic review of 16 studies using CS models to predict PPH. None of the included studies were considered by the authors to be ready for clinical application, especially due to the absence of external validation and use of variables that are known after birth.53 In a previous review, Neary et al evaluated 14 CS models for PPH prediction and reported some potential for their use only for specific subgroups as CS, placenta accreta spectrum and pernicious placenta previa.10 The results obtained from ML models for predicting PPH are promising, since ML approaches appear to be able to predict PPH with greater accuracy than CS. However, the possibility of using a large number of predictors might limit the use of ML models in the daily hospital routine. Models with a large number of predictors may require automation for their practical implementation, which is particularly limiting in low-middle and lower-middle-income countries. The main limitation of our review was the high variability among the studies. There were expressive differences in the subgroup of analysis, number of women, definition of PPH, number of predictors and study design, resulting in clinical and methodological diversity that makes it difficult to compare accuracy across studies. Nevertheless, we identified two studies with sufficiently methodological homogeneity and low ROB comparing ML models and CS models in the same sample population and using the same group of analysis and the same definition of PPH. The analysis of these two studies pointed to a 95% higher chance of PPH prediction using ML in relation to CS. We addressed moderate heterogeneity with the random-effect meta-analysis, considering the mean effect across studies. This way, we alert caution for the OR 1.95 interpretation as a limitation. Venkatesh et al assessed 152 279 births to develop predictive models using both CS and ML and reported the extreme gradient boosting model to have the best discriminative ability to predict PPH, after temporal and site validation.27 ML models were shown to perform the best but at the cost of possibly increased complexity and minimal clinical significance, as CS models had lower, but also good discriminative ability. Zheutlin et al compared their ML model with three clinical risk-assessment tools and one previously published model and found the 24-feature ML model to be superior to all the other currently used tools.40 Implications for future research Martins et al found vaginal delivery to be a protective factor for PPH, while multiple pregnancy, active bleeding on admission, non-cephalic presentation, retained placenta and placenta abruption were shown to be the strongest risk factors of PPH.54 These risk factors are in line with those used as predictors described in this review. However, the identification of isolated risk factors has been proven to be insufficient to identify women at high risk of PPH. The use of ML approaches might enhance PPH prediction by analysing complex interactions between combined risk factors and identifying risk patterns associated with PPH.

Conclusions The enlarging use of ML models has shown promising results and potential for enhancing the accuracy of PPH prediction. Nevertheless, its applicability or requirement of automation through digital systems still challenges its practical implementation, as well as the limited literature. Additional comparative studies are needed to confirm the potential superiority of ML over CS in predicting PPH. Furthermore, risk factors for PPH have been widely described by multiple previous studies. Despite this, this knowledge is still insufficient to identify women at highest risk for PPH. ML approaches might contribute to improving the prediction of PPH through the analysis of complex nonlinear interactions and identification of new risk patterns.
