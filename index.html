          <p>Céline Dion called out the misuse of her music, likeness and image through artificial intelligence that has been circulating “fake and not approved” songs outside of her official discography online.

“It has come to our attention that unsanctioned, AI-generated music purporting to contain Celine Dion’s musical performances, and name and likeness, is currently circulating online and across various digital service providers,” Dion said in a post to her official Instagram page Friday. “Please be advised that these recordings are fake and not approved, and are not songs from her official discography.”

The post did not detail what AI songs the singer was referencing specifically, but Rolling Stone reports that it is likely involves a viral YouTube video of the gospel song “Heal Me Lord” that has over 1 million views and purports to be the singer.

Dion is one of the many celebrities who have spoken out about their likeness and image being used to warp or recreate content online. Back in September 2023, Stephen Fry and his agents said they were “shocked” when they heard a ripped version of the actor’s voice online.

“I said not one word of that — it was a machine. Yes, it shocked me,” Fry said, who served as narrator for the “Harry Potter” series in between 1999 and 2007 said at the GogXFestival, per Fortune. “They used my reading of the seven volumes of the ‘Harry Potter’ books, and from that dataset an AI of my voice was created, and it made that new narration.”

He added: “What you heard was not the result of a mashup. This is from a flexible artificial voice, where the words are modulated to fit the meaning of each sentence.”

AI still remains as one of the major pain points for Hollywood creatives/artists following the 2023 strikes. Many actors and creatives have expressed concerns over the abuse of the technology.

          <p>In a nutshell: McDonald's is turning to artificial intelligence to improve operations at 43,000 restaurants. The initiative, according to Chief Information Officer Brian Rice, will help crews deal with daily stressors including customer and vendor interactions as well as equipment failures.

The Wall Street Journal notes that McDonald's starting rolling out edge computing platforms at some of its US restaurants last year, and plans to add more to the mix in 2025.

The new tech affords a host of possibilities. Computer vision, for example, could check for accuracy using fixed cameras in the kitchen before an order is passed along to a customer. Automated order-taking AI, like the kind McDonald's tested with IBM last year, could streamline drive-thru orders. Sensors installed on kitchen equipment could collect data in real time and use it to better predict when deep fryers or ice cream machines are most likely to fail.

Elsewhere, edge computing could help restaurant managers with administrative tasks. A "generative AI virtual manager, similar to ones Taco Bell and Pizza Hut have been testing, would make it easier for managers to perform shift scheduling.

McDonald's would not say how many locations in the US currently have edge computing capabilities in use. As Sandeep Unni, a retail analyst at market research firm Gartner, highlights, the popular burger giant will no doubt face difficulty when it comes to rolling out the tech across franchise and corporate owned locations. Deployment costs are also a concern, Unni added.

Whether or not the technology supplements are needed is partially a matter of personal opinion. One could argue that funding for the initiative could perhaps be better spent on improving employee training and tightening up routine maintenance. If staff was more efficient at tasks like taking drive-thru orders and ensuring order accuracy, AI overlords wouldn't be needed.

Rival fast food outfits like In-N-Out and Chick-fil-A have perfected customer service, and there's little reason why others couldn't replicate their success if it were made a priority.
