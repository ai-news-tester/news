Google Messages has introduced an artificial intelligence (AI)-based feature to protect Android users from text message-based scams. The new AI-powered scam detection tool aims to tackle messages that start harmless but eventually turn dangerous for the user, according to a blog post by the company.

“If Google Messages suspects a scam, you’ll receive a real-time warning so you can easily block and report the conversation. This feature can help protect you before you lose money or sensitive information,” the company explained, adding that users would not have to worry about their conversations being made public, as the scam detection would take place on the device.

How Would It Work?

To demonstrate, Google attached the following image of a probable scam scenario:

The image displays an Android user receiving a text from an unknown number asking if they are ‘Mary.’ While the user replies that they are not the intended recipient, the sender introduces themselves as a financial adviser, saying they were trying to reach a client with some investment information.

At this point, the scam detection tool kicks into action, displaying a pop-up message alerting the user about the incoming texts being a ‘Likely Scam’, alongside a further note that ‘common scams often start this way’.

Rollout

According to a report by The Verge, Google will first launch the feature in English in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada, with plans to expand to other countries later.

Why it Matters

Interestingly, even though Google’s attempt at securing users from potential scams can see benefits, a concern that rises to the fore following this has more to do with handling user data.

Advertisements

“The feature is on by default and only monitors conversations with people who aren’t saved to your contacts list,” the report further notes, which raises questions as to what Google does with users’ responses to messages from random senders.

To put it simply, whatever information a user reveals about themselves after being prompted with such an uninitiated conversation is accessible by the company. While a single instance might not be enough to accumulate enough data about an individual, repeated potential scam-like situations, to which the user responds and provides data about themselves initially, can likely be enough to structure the profile of that particular person. This, when seen in the context of data privacy and data collection norms under jurisdictional regulations such as India’s draft Digital Personal Data Protection Rules, 2025, that operationalises the DPDP Act, 2023, could lead to companies having to rethink collecting user data and related consent.

          <p>KUALA LUMPUR: British chip giant Arm Holdings signed an agreement with Malaysia on Wednesday (Mar 5) to bolster the Southeast Asian country's efforts to produce high-end semiconductors amid the US-China tech trade war.

Malaysia is a key player in the vital chips sector but has been largely focused on packaging, assembly and testing services - the lower end of the market.

The agreement will see Softbank-owned Arm provide chip designs and other technology, helping Malaysia to move into more value-added production such as wafer fabrication and integrated circuit design.

The Southeast Asian nation is paying US$250 million over a decade to receive support from the British company, journalists were told at a briefing by Malaysia's economic ministry.

"Through a comprehensive partnership with Arm, we have conceived one of the most ambitious technological plans Malaysia has ever seen - to pioneer Made-by-Malaysia AI chips," Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said in remarks before witnessing the signing.

"These chips will be designed, manufactured, tested and assembled here, and sold to the rest of the world."

In addition, Arm will also establish its first office in Southeast Asia in Kuala Lumpur, aiming to expand the company's reach in the region as well as Australia and New Zealand, Anwar said.

"We won't let you down. This is going to be an extremely exciting 10 years and more," said Arm chief executive Rene Haas.</p>

          <p>Cohere For AI, the firm's open research division, released new state-of-the-art (SOTA) vision models on Tuesday. Dubbed Aya Vision, the artificial intelligence (AI) models are available in two parameter sizes. The company's latest frontier models address the inconsistent performance of existing large language models (LLMs) across different languages, especially for multimodal tasks. Aya Vision models can generate outputs in 23 languages and can perform both text-based and image-based tasks. However, it cannot generate images. Cohere has made the AI models available on open-source repositories as well as via WhatsApp.

Cohere Releases Aya Vision AI Models

In a blog post, the AI firm detailed the new vision models. Aya Vision is available in 8B and 32B parameter sizes. These models can generate text, translate text and images across 23 languages, analyse images and answer queries about them, as well as caption images. Both models can be accessed via Cohere's Hugging Face page and on Kaggle.

Additionally, general users can try out Cohere's models via a dedicated WhatsApp chat account that can be accessed here. The company says the Aya Vision models are useful for instances when people come across images or artworks they would like to learn more about.

Based on the company's internal testing, the Aya Vision 8B model outperforms Qwen2.5-VL 7B, Gemini Flash 1.5 8B, and Llama 3.2 11B Vision models on the AyaVisionBench and m-WildVision benchmarks. Notably, the AyaVisionBench benchmark was also developed by Cohere, and its details have been shared in the public domain.

Coming to the Aya Vision 32B model, the company claimed that it outperformed Llama 3.2 90B Vision and Qwen2-VL 72B models on the same benchmarks.

To achieve frontier performance, Cohere claimed that several algorithmic innovations were developed. The Aya Vision models were fed synthetic annotations, developers scaled up multilingual data through translation and rephrasing, and multiple multimodal models were merged in separate steps. The developers observed that in each step, the performance was significantly improved.

Notably, developers can access the open weights of the Aya Vision models from Kaggle and Hugging Face, however, these models are available with a Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial 4.0 license. It allows for academic and research-based usage but prohibits commercial use cases.</p>
