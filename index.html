Apple is slowly upgrading its entire device lineup to adopt its artificial intelligence features under the Apple Intelligence umbrella. Although progress is going at a snail's pace for iPads, with the newest iPad base model excluded from the AI features entirely, the company is also highlighting its focus on third-party integrations with Apple Intelligence.

Some of these integrations have been around since the release of Apple Intelligence, while others are just now reaching their intended potential.

In its current state, Apple Intelligence is limited to relatively simple, almost entry-level features, such as Writing Tools to generate and summarize text and other AI tools for art generation. While the offerings are expected to expand with future updates, you can now use these tools in third-party apps, which often elevates the power of the available Apple Intelligence tools.

For example, you can use Image Playground, Apple's generative art tool, to generate images within a Final Cut Pro project and then drop these images into the timeline to create a shot list or AI-generated storyboard. This can be done on an iPad, MacBook, or Mac compatible with Apple Intelligence.

For iPad, you can use your Apple Pencil or Apple Pencil Pro to integrate live drawings and scribbles into third-party apps. You can also elevate your note-taking game: The Notability app for iPad has Apple Intelligence integrations that let you use text generation and image generation features within your notes, Apple Pencil or not.

Similarly, the Bear notes app supports Apple Intelligence features almost as natively as the Apple Notes app, with some exceptions. With Apple Intelligence within Bear, you can select text, create a table of key points and summaries, and generate images with Image Playground to make content more scannable.

Morpholio Trace, a designer app for creative professionals, also features integrations powered by AI and the neural engine necessary to support Apple Intelligence. You can run the app on an iPad Air with an M3 processor and enjoy the ease of removing an image's background with a couple of taps and real-time rendering of complex graphics.

The new MacBook Air with the Apple M4 chip, iPad Air with the M3 chip, Mac Studio with an M4 Max chip, and M3 Ultra support all advanced graphics architectures. But they are also a great way to test the neural engine's capabilities with Apple Intelligence.

These tools are more accessible than ever on midrange and high-end Apple devices, making it easier for students, small business owners, creators, and independent contractors to keep their AI running on-device and secure Apple servers.

While Apple has already released plenty of its promised AI features, we're looking forward to the iOS 18.5 drop to really see what makes Apple Intelligence stand out. The 18.5 update is a few months from the general release, with the iOS 18.4 update only in beta testing.

iOS 18.5 is expected to bring the more attention-grabbing Siri updates that Apple showcased during its last WWDC event last summer. This is where you'll be able to use Siri's touted on-screen awareness, integrations with various native and third-party apps, and a more natural, conversational style that maintains the context of your preferences.</p>

          <p>What if we told you that artificial intelligence (AI) systems such as ChatGPT don’t actually learn? Many people we talk to are genuinely surprised to hear this.

Even AI systems themselves will often tell you confidently that they are learning systems. Many reports and even academic papers say the same. But this is due to a misconception – or rather a loose understanding of what we mean by “learning” in AI.

Yet, understanding more precisely how and when AI systems learn (and when they don’t) will make you a more productive and more responsible user of AI.

AI does not learn – at least not like humans do

Many misconceptions around AI stem from using words that have a certain meaning when applied to humans, such as learning. We know how humans learn, because we do it all the time. We have experiences; we do something that fails; we encounter something new; we read something surprising; and thus we remember, we update or change the way we do things.

This is not how AI systems learn. There are two main differences.

Firstly, AI systems do not learn from any specific experiences, which would allow them to understand things the way we humans do. Rather they “learn” by encoding patterns from vast amounts data – using mathematics alone. This happens during the training process, when they are built.

Take large language models, such as GPT-4, the technology that powers ChatGPT. In a nutshell, it learns by encoding mathematical relationships between words (actually, tokens), with the aim to make predictions about what text goes with what other text. These relationships are extracted from vast amounts of data and encoded during a computationally intensive training phase.

This form of “learning” is obviously very different to how humans learn.

It has certain downsides in that AI often struggles with simple commonsense knowledge about the world that humans naturally learn by just living in the world.

But AI training is also incredibly powerful, because large language models have “seen” text at a scale far beyond what any human can comprehend. That’s why these systems are so useful with language-based tasks, such as writing, summarising, coding, or conversing. The fact these systems don’t learn like us, but at a vast scale, makes them all-rounders in the kinds of things they do excel at.

Once trained, the learning stops

Most AI systems that most people use, such as ChatGPT, also do not learn once they are built. You could say AI systems don’t learn at all – training is just how they’re built, it’s not how they work. The “P” in GPT literally stands for “pre-trained”.

In technical terms, AI systems such as ChatGPT only engage in “training-time learning”, as part of their development, not in “run-time learning”. Systems that learn as they go do exist. But they are typically confined to a single task, for example your Netflix algorithm recommending what to watch. Once it’s done, it’s done, as the saying goes.

Being “pre-trained” means large language models are always stuck in time. Any updates to their training data require highly costly retraining, or at least so-called fine-tuning for smaller adjustments.

That means ChatGPT does not learn from your prompts on an ongoing basis. And out of the box, a large language model does not remember anything. It holds in its memory only whatever occurs in a single chat session. Close the window, or start a new session, and it’s a clean sheet every time.

There are ways around this, such as storing information about the user, but they are achieved at the application level; the AI model itself does not learn and remains unchanged until retrained (more on that in a moment).

What does this mean for users?

First, be aware of what you get from your AI assistant.

Learning from text data means systems such as ChatGPT are language models, not knowledge models. While it is truly amazing how much knowledge gets encoded via the mathematical training process, these models are not always reliable when asked knowledge questions.

Their real strength is working with language. And don’t be surprised when responses contain outdated information given they are frozen in time, or that ChatGPT does not remember any facts you tell it.

The good news is AI developers have come up with some clever workarounds. For example, some versions of ChatGPT are now connected to the internet. To provide you with more timely information they might perform a web search and insert the result into your prompt before generating the response.

Another workaround is that AI systems can now remember things about you to personalise their responses. But this is done with a trick. It is not that the large language model itself learns or updates itself in real time. The information about you is stored in a separate database and is inserted into the prompt each time in ways that remain invisible.

But it still means that you can’t correct the model when it gets something wrong (or teach it a fact), which it would remember to correct its answers for other users. The model can be personalised to an extent, but it still does not learn on the fly.

Users who understand how exactly AI learns – or doesn’t – will invest more in developing effective prompting strategies, and treat the AI as an assistant – one that always needs checking.

Let the AI assist you. But make sure you do the learning, prompt by prompt.</p>

AI’s Role in the Renewal of Puppetry Art

According to Union International De La Marionnette ,Oral histories trace puppetry back to the 9th century BCE. The Mahabharata, composed around the 4th century BCE, contains the earliest references to puppetry in India. The Sanskrit grammarian Panini described puppets in the 4th century BCE, and Patanjali, the author of the Yoga Sutras, mentioned them in the 2nd century BCE. The Tamil poet Thiruvalluvar, also from the 2nd century BCE, stated, “The actions of a person whose wisdom is not sensitive are like the imitation of life by puppets moved by strings.” Richard Pischel (1849–1908), a prominent German scholar, emphasized Indian puppetry’s significance and argued that India was the root of Western puppetry traditions.

Puppetry has been an essential part of India’s rich cultural heritage. Beyond being an entertainment medium, it has played a vital role in tradition, education, and social messaging. However, preserving this ancient art and passing it on to future generations has become increasingly difficult. AI has the potential to revolutionize and expand this art form by aiding in digitization, ensuring the preservation of traditional puppet designs, performance techniques, and folklore. Furthermore, AI-driven virtual experiences, interactive digital performances, and learning systems can introduce classical works to contemporary audiences.

Technological advancements will enable puppetry artists to reach global audiences. AI-powered 3D modeling, animation, virtual reality (VR), and augmented reality (AR) can elevate their craft to new levels. Additionally, AI-driven e-commerce platforms, online performances, and digital museums could create new employment opportunities for puppetry artists. As a result, AI will not only digitally preserve puppetry but also revitalize it on a global scale, ensuring its relevance in modern times.

Ethics, AI, and Education: The Impact of the Indian Knowledge System

India’s ancient educational system was rooted in the Gurukul tradition, the Vedas, and the Upanishads. It emphasized not only knowledge dissemination but also moral and practical values. In the modern era, AI-powered learning systems can significantly enhance traditional teaching methodologies. Smart classrooms, virtual tutors, and AI-driven personalized learning programs can improve the efficiency of education. By tailoring courses to individual students’ strengths and learning styles, AI can make education more inclusive and accessible.Ethical and conscious development is crucial in AI, a principle that aligns closely with Indian philosophical thought. Indian philosophy can help address AI-related ethical concerns such as justice, data privacy, and the societal impacts of automation. Concepts from the Bhagavad Gita and the Upanishads, including Dharma (righteousness), Ahimsa (non-violence), and Karma (action), can guide the development of AI in a more responsible and ethical manner. By integrating the Indian knowledge system into AI development, technology can progress while maintaining a balance between ethics and innovation.

AI-Powered Healthcare Solutions and Ayurveda

AI-driven predictive analytics and diagnostic tools have the potential to enhance healthcare efficiency. These technologies can help predict future health issues and improve disease diagnosis. By utilizing machine learning and natural language processing, valuable insights can be extracted from Ayurvedic literature, leading to improved treatment and diagnostic capabilities.

This can lead to greater efficiency in data processing, cybersecurity, and financial analysis. By applying ancient Indian mathematical principles to mathematical modeling, pattern recognition, and cryptography, AI algorithms can be made more effective and accurate. Thus, integrating AI with Vedic mathematics has the potential to significantly boost computational efficiency.

Natural Language Processing in Sanskrit

Sanskrit, with its logically and mathematically structured grammar, is highly useful for natural language processing (NLP). Panini’s grammatical rules provide a strong foundation for automated language processing. AI-powered chatbots and translation systems based on Sanskrit can greatly enhance language accuracy and efficiency.

The Role of AI in Yoga and Mental Health

Yoga and meditation have long been recognized for their mental health benefits. AI-powered applications can make these ancient practices more accessible and effective. By analyzing physiological data such as heart rate, breathing patterns, and brain waves, these apps can offer personalized yoga and meditation recommendations. AI-driven mental health monitoring systems can also assess emotional states and suggest appropriate practices to manage stress, anxiety, and depression. This technology can make mental health care more personalized and scientifically validated, helping individuals achieve better overall well-being.

AI’s Role in the Indian Economy

According to Price water house Coopers (PwC), AI-driven data economies are expected to contribute $15.7 trillion to global GDP by 2030, surpassing the combined GDP of China and India. However, India’s AI adoption faces several challenges, including a shortage of skilled AI professionals, resistance from the existing workforce, and outdated government systems. Overcoming these obstacles will require advancements in networking, cybersecurity, and data infrastructure.

Challenges and Solutions

While integrating AI with the Indian knowledge system offers numerous benefits, it also presents significant challenges. Standardizing knowledge, digitizing ancient texts, and incorporating traditional teachings into modern AI systems are complex tasks. To achieve this, collaboration among historians, AI researchers, and traditional scholars is essential to ensure technological advancements align with cultural and ethical considerations.

Furthermore, India can establish itself as a global AI leader by implementing transformative changes in governance, healthcare, education, and agriculture. By merging traditional knowledge with modern technology, India can drive AI-led innovation while prioritizing human well-being. This coordinated approach will enable India to play a significant role in shaping the future of AI on a global scale.
