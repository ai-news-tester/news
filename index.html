          <p>Socure has introduced a new tool designed to combat repeat first-party fraud.

The new Identity Manipulation Risk Score, which is now embedded within Sigma First-Party Fraud, uses artificial intelligence (AI) and real-time data from Socure’s fraud intelligence network to help organizations detect bad actors at account opening and throughout the customer lifecycle, the company said in a Thursday (March 6) press release.

“Identity manipulation is at the core of predicting first-party fraud, as most fraud prevention solutions fail to detect it,” Ori Snir, head of product management, fraud and identity solutions at Socure, said in the release.

Socure’s first-party fraud consortium enables it to gather fraud intelligence from a variety of sectors, including financial institutions, FinTechs, payment platforms, sports betting companies and merchants, according to the release.

With this network, the company can perform real-time analysis of data from millions of identities and billions of transactions, including dispute histories, payment denials and account closures, the release said.

Organizations can use this solution to quantify the likelihood of identity manipulation at critical decision points and combat first-party fraud, which is difficult to detect because it involves bad actors using their own real, verified credentials, per the release.

“With the launch of the Identity Manipulation Risk Score, we’re giving organizations the ability to proactively assess risk before financial losses occur, using AI-powered predictive analytics that stop bad actors in their tracks,” Snir said in the release.

Socure said in October 2023 that it launched Sigma First-Party Fraud and the First-Party Fraud Consortium (FPFC) to help companies detect and prevent first-party fraud.

The company said at the time that the FPFC aims to detect and prevent first-party fraud by analyzing alternative data signals that are not typically tracked in traditional credit reports.

By collaborating and sharing data among consortium members, the FPFC can identify patterns of fraudulent behavior across multiple platforms and over time, stopping fraud before it takes hold.

In December, Socure said the FPFC had compiled data intelligence covering 190 million contributed identities, 121 million of which were unique identities, along with 325 million accounts and 20 billion transactions, “marketing an unprecedented collaboration in financial services history.”</p>

          <p>Welcome to “The AI Break,” the blog series that helps you stay ahead of the curve of artificial intelligence (AI). Follow along to discover what’s new as we demystify AI topics, reveal insights to help you overcome the latest challenges, and keep shaping our best future in the rapidly evolving tech landscape.

Let’s start by seizing the opportunity that AI brings to the world of networks and network engineering: to become more strategic, creative, and collaborative, and embrace the one skill that stands out to help us get there—adaptability.

The one constant is change

The networking world has always been in flux.

Protocols evolve. New security threats emerge. Businesses demand faster, more reliable connectivity.

Today, we face yet another seismic shift with AI-driven tools and automation taking center stage. But this one isn’t cataclysmic.

Good news, network engineers: It’s your time to thrive

With the help of AI and automation, more and more of the low-level cognitive tasks that once helped to fill your busy schedule—like routine troubleshooting, baseline monitoring, and repetitive configurations—are being offloaded to AI systems. Now, you have more time for higher-order problem-solving.

This is a fantastic opportunity to turn things around in your favor and take this opportunity to thrive. The one skill that stands out as crucial for thriving in this new environment is adaptability. Here’s why.

What AI does best: taking over lower-level tasks

AI and automation can handle a host of manual processes. For a network engineer or cyber analyst, these lower-level cognitive tasks might include:

Log analysis. AI-driven platforms are great at parsing syslogs, NetFlow records, and security alerts to identify anomalies or suspicious patterns.

Automated scripts and CI/CD pipelines now manage large-scale updates with minimal human intervention. Basic troubleshooting. From resetting a malfunctioning port to rerouting traffic around a failed link, an AI-based system can often spot the problem and propose a fix faster than any human scrolling through logs.

These tasks gobble up a significant chunk of an engineer’s day, creating potential bottlenecks and limiting the focus on big-picture network architecture or advanced security strategies.

What AI frees you up to do

Once AI handles the mundane chores, you have room to invest your energy in strategic endeavors, like the following options:

Creative problem-solving. With automation watching over routine alerts, you can focus on designing more resilient networks, integrating multi-cloud strategies, and exploring new technologies like intent-based networking.

AI, automation, and orchestration tools are improving almost daily. Adaptable engineers don’t cling to the old ways — they learn fast, integrate new solutions, and pivot their strategies as needed. Greater interdisciplinary demands. Networking is no longer just about switches and routers. It often intersects with DevOps, cybersecurity, cloud services, and beyond. You’ll need to adapt to different team cultures and collaborate on cross-functional projects, where technology challenges can shift weekly.

Networking is no longer just about switches and routers. It often intersects with DevOps, cybersecurity, cloud services, and beyond. You’ll need to adapt to different team cultures and collaborate on cross-functional projects, where technology challenges can shift weekly. Navigating unknowns. AI can be a “black box.” Sometimes, you might not fully understand how an algorithm arrived at a particular recommendation. Adaptable engineers don’t just shrug their shoulders; they research, question, and refine the system to align with business goals. This kind of flexibility in the face of uncertainty is pure gold.

How to build your adaptability muscle

Consider these helpful tips for ways to exercise adaptability:

Stay curious. Dive into diverse skill areas — everything from Python scripting to advanced security features. Curiosity is the engine of adaptability.

Dive into diverse skill areas — everything from Python scripting to advanced security features. Curiosity is the engine of adaptability. Leverage learning opportunities. After deploying a new AI-driven tool or implementing an automated workflow, reflect on the results. What worked? What do you think needs improvement? How might you adapt next time?

After deploying a new AI-driven tool or implementing an automated workflow, reflect on the results. What worked? What do you think needs improvement? How might you adapt next time? Embrace failure. Not every automation script or AI insight will be spot on. Adaptable engineers view missteps as growth opportunities, using the lessons to refine both the technology and their approach.

Not every automation script or AI insight will be spot on. Adaptable engineers view missteps as growth opportunities, using the lessons to refine both the technology and their approach. Be open to new perspectives. Work with teams outside your immediate domain. Hearing different perspectives broadens your thinking, revealing angles you might not have considered.

Seize this opportunity

As AI and automation mature, they’ll take over more of the lower-level, day-to-day tasks that once filled a network engineer’s schedule. That’s fantastic news — if you seize the opportunity to become more strategic, creative, and collaborative.

Adaptability isn’t just a soft skill, it’s the key to thriving when the stakes are high and the technology is evolving at warp speed. If you stay curious, embrace continuous learning, and remain open to new working methods, you’ll do more than keep pace with AI.

Let’s stay curious together. I’m excited to learn alongside you — let’s keep pushing boundaries and sharpening our AI skills one break at a time!
