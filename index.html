McDonald’s to employ AI at 43K locations to speed up service: ‘Technology solutions will alleviate the stress’

NY Post ^ | 03/06/2025 | Brooke Steinberg

Posted on by DFG

McDonald’s is the latest fast food restaurant to use artificial intelligence to step up its game.

The fast food giant is overhauling all 43,000 restaurants with an AI makeover in an attempt to cut wait times and make a better experience for both customers and employees.

Upgrades will start with internet-connected kitchen equipment, AI-enabled drive-throughs and AI-powered tools for managers to help make sure that orders are accurate and so restaurants can predict equipment issues before they shut down.

To accomplish this mission, the company tapped Google Cloud in late 2023 to implement more computing power in restaurants, allowing them to process and analyze data on-site. Known as edge computing, the setup is generally a faster and cheaper option than sending the data to the cloud.

Suppliers have already begun to install sensors on the equipment that will ultimately give the data to the system and allow employees to see how the restaurant is operating in real time.

Well good luck with that. I’d prefer they clean up the e. Coli in the food. Something I managed to acquire through their restaurants. Twice. Once last year, traveling through Nebraska. After recovery another bout from a large square state. Don’t eat their too often, doubt I’ll ever eat there again. They even screwed up my order the second time. Slow service. Expensive. Small portions. Not all that tasty any longer. Yeah, I deserve a break today, it ain’t gonna be at McDonalds

“How will they teach AI to get my order wrong every time?” AI ordering at Wendy’s works great. I don’t understand why it is on at my store only about 20% of the time.

The McDonald’s in my town is legendary for messing up orders, preparing food incorrectly, being out of things such as shakes and......hamburger patties needed for Quarter Pounders. I haven’t been in there for a long time so I might stop by after the tech upgrade to see if it had made any difference.

Gemini: There are several reasons why people might make fun of AI:

* AI’s limitations and errors:

* AI, especially in its current state, can produce outputs that are factually incorrect, nonsensical, or hilariously off-target. These errors can be a source of amusement.

* AI’s struggle with nuances of language, humor, and common sense can lead to comical misunderstandings.

* The contrast between human and artificial intelligence:

* People often find humor in the contrast between the perceived intelligence of AI and its actual capabilities.

* The idea of a machine trying to mimic human behavior, but falling short, can be inherently funny.

* Fear and uncertainty:

* For some, making fun of AI can be a way to cope with anxieties about its potential impact on society.

* Humor can be a defense mechanism against the unknown and the potentially threatening.

* The “uncanny valley” effect:

* When AI or robots appear almost human, but not quite, they can evoke feelings of unease or even revulsion. This can sometimes manifest as mockery.

* AI’s lack of genuine understanding:

* AI can mimic creativity, but it lacks the genuine lived experience and emotional depth that drives human creativity. This difference can be made fun of.

Essentially, it’s a mix of finding genuine comedic moments in AI’s errors, and also using humor to deal with the complex feelings that arise from the rapid advancement of AI technology.

McDonald’s is the latest fast food restaurant to use artificial intelligence to step up its game. It is being implemented in California to cut labor costs - such as California's mandated $20/hour minimum wage for burger flippers - soon to go up. Two medium-sized McRib meals at McDonald's cost over $30 now - ordered from a kiosk only, no one was at the front counter. Despite governor Newsom recently stating that "no jobs have been lost" in fast food due to the increase in the minimum wage, and, in fact, jobs are expanding: California’s minimum wage increase led to job losses, higher prices: Study A new study shows that California's minimum wage increase for fast-food workers led to job cuts, higher menu prices and increased automation. In April 2023, California raised the minimum wage for fast-food workers from $16.50 to $20 an hour. Specifically, between June 2023 and June 2024, 10,700 fast-food jobs were lost, and menu prices rose by 14.5%. Meanwhile, nearly 89% of restaurant operators reduced employee hours and replaced labor with technology, as 35% cut employee benefits. The study concluded that Californians are facing fewer job opportunities and higher food costs due to the wage hike.
