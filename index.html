Ronaldinho Ga√∫cho has become a "specialist" in being the protagonist of "random roles" since his retirement from the fields.

And it won't be different this Carnival.

Now 44 years old, the idol of Barcelona and Atl√©tico-MG will be the attraction in Salvador this Saturday (1) and next Monday (3).

The former Bloco Broder Loopi has become "Bloco Broder Loopi do Bruxo" thanks to the presence of the ex-player.

Bloco that will parade in the Dod√¥ circuit (Barra-Ondina) of the Bahian capital.

And it already had a former player as "protagonist": Ed√≠lson, also a World Champion with the Brazilian National Team. He is the ambassador of the same.

‚ÄòInvej√°vel‚Äô list of random roles

The closing ceremony of the 2018 World Cup in Russia would "go unnoticed".

That's when Ronaldinho appeared "out of nowhere" calling for the spotlight.

Launched in 2018, the movie "Kickboxer - The Revenge" had some special appearances.

R10 was one of them, playing Ronaldo, a prisoner and martial arts fighter and specialist in... kicks! Mike Tyson was also part of this work.

The Turkish version of the program "No Limite" in 2021 had the presence of R10.

Who showed his talent playing footvolley with the participants.

Was anyone expecting him there? No!

How about a lesson on how to make cigars... in China!

That's what happened in November 2023.

Even the COP20, the UN's annual conference on climate change, had Ronaldinho's presence.

He was invited by the government of AZERBAIJ√ÉO in the edition held in November last year in the capital Baku. He even posted photos there.

There was also, for example, the purchase of a football club in the USA, also in 2024.

Ronaldinho and his brother Assis became shareholders of the Greenville Triumph, which disputes the USL League One, equivalent to the North American Third Division.

The goal is to reach the MLS in a near future after an invitation/approval from the League.

The Greenville Triumph fell in the semifinals of the last edition of the USL League One to champion Union Omaha.

Encountering coding errors in artificial intelligence (AI) projects can feel overwhelming, but a structured approach can transform the troubleshooting process into a manageable and efficient task. This guide outlines a practical three-step method to help you systematically identify and resolve coding issues. By using AI tools, conducting precise online searches, and simplifying your code, you can address errors with greater confidence and accuracy.

This guide by Corbin Brown introduces a simple yet effective three-step method to help you tackle coding errors with clarity and confidence. By combining the strengths of AI tools, the collective wisdom of online communities, and a back-to-basics approach to your code, you‚Äôll be able to break free from those frustrating error loops and get back on track. Whether you‚Äôre troubleshooting authentication issues or wrestling with dependency conflicts, this tutorial offers a practical framework to help you navigate the debugging process with less stress and more success.

Debugging AI Programming Issues

TL;DR Key Takeaways : Use AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Claude AI for debugging by providing detailed input, but remain cautious of their limitations and reset sessions if needed.

Conduct targeted online searches on platforms like Stack Overflow and Reddit to find solutions for specific coding issues, especially for niche or complex problems.

Simplify your code by isolating problematic functionality to identify root causes, then reintroduce components incrementally after resolving the issue.

Use version control systems like Git to track changes and pinpoint when errors occur, aiding in efficient debugging.

Adopt smarter debugging practices, such as taking breaks to avoid fatigue and documenting solutions for recurring problems to save time in the future.

1: Maximize the Potential of AI Chatbots

AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Claude AI can serve as powerful debugging tools, but their effectiveness hinges on how you interact with them. To get the most accurate and relevant suggestions, provide clear and detailed input. Include specifics such as your operating system, programming language, frameworks, APIs, and any error messages you‚Äôve encountered. This context enables the AI to offer tailored advice that aligns with your problem.

Despite their utility, AI tools have limitations. They may occasionally provide outdated or incorrect information, particularly for niche or rapidly evolving technologies. Additionally, chatbots can sometimes fall into ‚Äúlooping‚Äù errors, where they repeat unhelpful advice. If this occurs, reset the conversation or start a new session to generate fresh insights. Always remember that AI tools are most effective when used as part of a broader problem-solving strategy rather than as a standalone solution.

2: Perform Targeted Online Searches

When AI tools don‚Äôt provide the answers you need, targeted online searches can bridge the gap. Platforms like Stack Overflow, Reddit programming forums, and other community-driven resources are invaluable for finding solutions to specific issues. These platforms often host discussions and solutions from experienced developers who have encountered similar challenges.

For instance, if you‚Äôre debugging Firebase functions and suspect a dependency issue, search for the exact error message along with the dependency version. This approach often leads to actionable insights and solutions tailored to your problem. Community forums are particularly useful for addressing edge cases or unique scenarios that AI tools might overlook. By combining AI-generated suggestions with the expertise of online communities, you can tackle even the most complex coding challenges.

3: Simplify Your Code

If errors persist despite your efforts, simplifying your code can help isolate the root cause. Begin by removing unrelated logic or creating a minimal project that focuses solely on the problematic functionality. For example, if you‚Äôre encountering authentication issues, strip away unrelated features and test the authentication code in isolation.

This method narrows down potential causes and helps determine whether the issue lies in your code or an external dependency. Once the problem is identified and resolved, reintroduce the removed components incrementally to ensure the overall system remains functional. Simplifying your code not only clarifies the issue but also improves your understanding of how different components interact.

Additional Tips for Smarter Debugging

To further enhance your debugging process, consider implementing these strategies:

Use version control systems like Git: Track changes in your code to identify when errors were introduced. This allows you to revert to earlier versions and isolate problematic updates.

Track changes in your code to identify when errors were introduced. This allows you to revert to earlier versions and isolate problematic updates. Take regular breaks: Debugging can be mentally taxing. Stepping away from the problem can provide a fresh perspective and reveal solutions you might have missed.

Debugging can be mentally taxing. Stepping away from the problem can provide a fresh perspective and reveal solutions you might have missed. Document recurring issues: Keep a record of solutions to common problems. This practice saves time and effort when similar errors arise in the future.

By incorporating these strategies into your workflow, you can streamline the debugging process and reduce the time spent resolving errors.

A Structured Approach to Debugging

By following these three steps‚Äîoptimizing AI chatbot usage, conducting targeted online searches, and simplifying your code‚Äîyou can approach coding errors with a clear and methodical strategy. This framework not only minimizes frustration but also equips you with practical tools to handle future challenges effectively. Whether you‚Äôre debugging authentication issues, resolving dependency conflicts, or addressing AI-specific errors, these techniques provide a structured and reliable path to resolution. With consistent practice, you‚Äôll develop a more intuitive understanding of debugging, allowing you to tackle even the most complex coding problems with confidence.

          <p>SAN FRANCISCO ‚Äî Almost every day, Grant Lee, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, hears from investors who try to persuade him to take their money. Some have even sent him and his co-founders personalized gift baskets.

Lee, 41, would normally be flattered. In the past, a fast-growing startup like Gamma, an artificial intelligence company he helped establish in 2020, would have constantly looked out for more funding.

But like many young startups in Silicon Valley today, Gamma is pursuing a different strategy. It is using AI tools to increase its employees‚Äô productivity in everything from customer service and marketing to coding and customer research.

That means Gamma, which makes software that lets people create presentations and websites, has no need for more cash, Lee said. His company has hired only 28 people to get ‚Äútens of millions‚Äù in annual recurring revenue and nearly 50 million users. Gamma is also profitable.

‚ÄúIf we were from the generation before, we would easily be at 200 employees,‚Äù Lee said. ‚ÄúWe get a chance to rethink that, basically rewrite the playbook.‚Äù

The old Silicon Valley model dictated that startups should raise a huge sum of money from venture capital investors and spend it hiring an army of employees to scale up fast. Profits would come much later. Until then, head count and fundraising were badges of honor among founders, who philosophized that bigger was better.

But Gamma is among a growing cohort of startups, most of them working on AI products, that are also using AI to maximize efficiency. They make money and are growing fast without the funding or employees they would have needed before. The biggest bragging rights for these startups are for making the most revenue with the fewest workers.

Stories of ‚Äútiny team‚Äù success have now become a meme, with techies excitedly sharing lists that show how Anysphere, a startup that makes the coding software Cursor, hit $100 million in annual recurring revenue in less than two years with just 20 employees, and how ElevenLabs, an AI voice startup, did the same with about 50 workers.

The potential for AI to let startups do more with less has led to wild speculation about the future. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has predicted there could someday be a one-person company worth $1 billion. His company, which is building a cost-intensive form of AI called a foundational model, employs more than 4,000 people and has raised more than $20 billion in funding. It is also in talks to raise more money.

With AI tools, some startups are now declaring that they will stop hiring at a certain size. Runway Financial, a finance software company, has said it plans to top out at 100 employees because each of its workers will do the work of 1.5 people. Agency, a startup using AI for customer service, also plans to hire no more than 100 workers.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about eliminating roles that are not necessary when you have smaller teams,‚Äù said Elias Torres, Agency‚Äôs founder.

The idea of AI-driven efficiency was bolstered last month by DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup that showed it could build AI tools for a small fraction of the typical cost. Its breakthrough, built on open-source tools that are freely available online, set off an explosion of companies building new products using DeepSeek‚Äôs inexpensive techniques.

‚ÄúDeepSeek was a watershed moment,‚Äù said Gaurav Jain, an investor at the venture firm Afore Capital, which has backed Gamma. ‚ÄúThe cost of compute is going to go down very, very fast, very quickly.‚Äù

Jain compared new AI startups to the wave of companies that arose in the late 2000s, after Amazon began offering cheap cloud computing services. That lowered the cost of starting a company, leading to a flurry of new startups that could be built more cheaply.

Before this AI boom, startups generally burned $1 million to get to $1 million in revenue, Jain said. Now, getting to $1 million in revenue costs one-fifth as much and could eventually drop to one-tenth, according to an analysis of 200 startups conducted by Afore.

‚ÄúThis time, we‚Äôre automating humans as opposed to just the data centers,‚Äù Jain said.

But if startups can become profitable without spending much, that could become a problem for venture capital investors, who allocate tens of billions to invest in AI startups. Last year, AI companies raised $97 billion in funding, making up 46% of all venture investment in the United States, according to PitchBook, which tracks startups.

‚ÄúVenture capital only works if you get money into the winners,‚Äù said Terrence Rohan, an investor with Otherwise Fund, which focuses on very young startups. He added: ‚ÄúIf the winner of the future needs a lot less money because they‚Äôll have a lot less people, how does that change VC?‚Äù

For now, investors continue to fight to get into the hottest companies, many of which have no need for more money. Scribe, an AI productivity startup, grappled last year with far more interest from investors than the $25 million it wanted to raise.

‚ÄúIt was a negotiation of what is the smallest amount we could possibly take on,‚Äù said Scribe CEO Jennifer Smith. She said investors were shocked at the size of her staff ‚Äî 100 people ‚Äî when compared with its 3 million users and fast growth.

Some investors are optimistic that AI-driven efficiency will spur entrepreneurs to create more companies, leading to more opportunities to invest. They hope that once the startups reach a certain size, the firms will adopt the old model of big teams and big money.

Some young companies, including Anysphere, are already doing that. Anysphere has raised $175 million in funding, with plans to add staff and conduct research, according to the company‚Äôs president, Oskar Schulz.

Other founders have seen the perils of the old startup playbook, which kept companies on a fundraising treadmill where hiring more people created more costs that went beyond just their salaries.

Bigger teams needed managers, more robust human resources and back-office support. Those teams then needed specialized software, along with a bigger office with all the perks ‚Äî and so on, which led startups to burn through cash and forced founders to constantly raise more money. Many startups from the funding boom of 2021 eventually downsized, shut down or scrambled to sell themselves.

Turning a profit early on can change that outcome. At Gamma, employees use about 10 AI tools to help them be more efficient, including Intercom‚Äôs customer service tool for handling problems, Midjourney‚Äôs image generator for marketing, Anthropic‚Äôs Claude chatbot for data analysis and Google‚Äôs NotebookLM for analyzing customer research. Engineers also use Anysphere‚Äôs Cursor to more efficiently write code.

Gamma‚Äôs product, which is built on top of tools from OpenAI and others, is also not as expensive to make as other AI products. (The New York Times has sued OpenAI and its partner, Microsoft, claiming copyright infringement of news content related to AI systems. The two companies have denied the suit‚Äôs claims.)

Other efficient startups are taking a similar strategy. Thoughtly, a 10-person provider of AI phone agents, turned a profit in 11 months, thanks to its use of AI, said co-founder Torrey Leonard.

Payment processor Stripe created an AI tool that helps Leonard analyze Thoughtly‚Äôs sales, something he would have previously hired an analyst to do. Without that and AI tools from others to streamline its operations, Thoughtly would need at least 25 people and be far from profitable, he said.

Thoughtly will eventually raise more money, Leonard said, but only when it is ready. Not worrying about running out of cash is ‚Äúa huge relief,‚Äù he said.

At Gamma, Lee said he planned to roughly double the workforce this year to 60, hiring for design, engineering and sales. He plans to recruit a different type of worker from before, seeking out generalists who do a range of tasks rather than specialists who do only one thing, he said. He also wants ‚Äúplayer-coaches‚Äù instead of managers ‚Äî people who can mentor less experienced employees but can also pitch in on the day-to-day work.

Lee said the AI-efficient model had freed up time he would have otherwise spent managing people and recruiting. Now, he focuses on talking to customers and improving the product. In 2022, he created a Slack room for feedback from Gamma‚Äôs top users, who are often shocked to discover that the CEO was responding to their comments.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs actually every founder‚Äôs dream,‚Äù Lee said.
