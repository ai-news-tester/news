          <p>Over 70% of marketers and small business owners in the world today use AI for SEO. That’s a staggering amount. Right? Well, AI is changing how businesses approach digital marketing. It enables systems to evaluate massive data, determine patterns, and make decisions with little or no human intervention.

So, now businesses can easily automate and optimise key aspects of SEO, such as keyword research, content creation, and website analysis. This allows businesses to get high search rankings and organic traffic more efficiently than with traditional methods. Let’s learn more about this below.

The integration of artificial intelligence in SEO

As mentioned earlier, many businesses are adopting the use of AI for SEO. They do so in several ways, including the following:

Automation of keyword research

Before AI, keyword research used to involve the tiring work of analysing volume and competition metrics. That’s not the case anymore. Now tools such as Ahrefs and SEMrush use machine learning to predict keyword trends.

This is more efficient and faster than the traditional methods of keyword research. AI quickly analyses a vast amount of data to identify relevant keywords, long-tail phrases, and competitor strategies.

So, it ensures a more targeted content creation. For instance, businesses currently focusing on SEO in Spain, use AI to get more targeted Spanish keywords. Then, they incorporate the keywords in their content to ensure higher search rankings and organic traffic.

Optimisation of technical SEO

You can now use AI to automate your technical SEO tasks. This includes identifying technical issues, such as slow loading times and defective links. What’s more, you can use AI to get an insight into where you need to improve your website.

Therefore, AI can help your website shine. This means that it can help you identify and fix issues that can affect your search engine ranking and things like bounce rate.

Content optimisation and creation

Today, many businesses use artificial intelligence to develop SEO-driven strategies. Any leading digital marketing agency, such as Seeders, will confirm that AI significantly simplifies and accelerates the process of content optimization and creation. For example, AI-powered tools like Frase, Clearscope, and Surfer SEO help analyze top-ranking content. They provide recommendations on keywords, structure, and readability.

What does this indicate? It means that you don’t have to do the tiring research work daily. AI can do it for you. In addition to the research, AI can help you write great pieces of content. Remember, it all lies in how you prompt it to write.

Enhancing user experience through AI-driven strategies

Have you ever gotten the feeling that Google knows what you think before you finish typing? Well, that’s the power of AI. Today, SEO isn’t just about stuffing keywords into articles or hoping your content will land on the first page.

It’s about semantic search and user intent. What’s more, AI ensures that businesses can deliver more personalised, intuitive, and efficient interactions. It does this by doing the following:

Analysing user behaviour and past interactions to ensure personalised content and experiences. For example, Amazon and Netflix will give you product or content recommendations based on your unique history. So this ensures better user engagement.

Using chatbots to provide instant responses to user queries. This helps to reduce wait times and ensure better customer support.

Predicting customer preferences. This ensures that marketing efforts are more personalised.

Predictive analytics: forecasting trends with AI

AI doesn’t just focus on history. It can also help you predict the future. AI uses statistical models, data analytics, and machine learning to predict the future. The best part? Its predictions are often accurate and can help your business stay ahead in competitive markets.

Therefore, you can use AI to analyse industry trends, social media sentiments and economic indicators. Then, use the data received to predict market shifts. At the same time, you can use that data to adjust your digital marketing strategies to ensure they align with future demands.

The benefits of using AI in predictive analytics are that:

It offers real-time insights.

It analyses large datasets quickly

It helps businesses to optimise their marketing efforts.

It ensures minimal error. So businesses can make decisions quickly.

Automating routine SEO tasks using machine learning

As mentioned earlier, machine learning is one of the things that AI uses to make predictive analytics. Apart from that, machine learning can be used to automate routine SEO tasks. This includes doing things like:

Analysing search trends, competitor rankings, and user intent to generate high-performing keywords. So, businesses that use AI for keyword research can stay ahead of trends and search terms.

Automating content audits to ensure that content aligns well with search engine algorithms.

Providing real-time suggestions for content optimisation, including areas where you can improve readability.

Identifying gaps in existing content and suggesting topics to improve search rankings by filling these gaps.

Identifying technical SEO issues, like broken links and page speed problems. Then providing ways to solve them.

Optimising images by automatically generating alt texts.

Case studies: success stories of AI in SEO

Many sites have successfully used AI to improve their SEO performance. They include:

Bankrate.com

Bankrate.com has successfully used AI to drive thousands of visits each month to their website. This website uses AI to create responses to questions that have specific limitations, such as “What is Financial Liquidity?” and “What is the Contribution Margin?”

So, when done right, AI content can help you achieve success. And Bankrate.com has proven that. The site also uses a human touch to fact-check and rewrite where necessary.

Rocky Brands

Rocky Brands is another company that has managed to successfully use AI for SEO. It has implemented the use of BrightEdge tools for formulating effective SEO strategies.

After the implementation of these AI tools, Rocky Brand experienced an increase of YOY revenue by 74%, search revenue by 30% and new users by 13%.

STACK Media

STACK Media also collaborated with BrightEdge to enhance their web traffic. This collaboration involved identifying high search volume keywords, analysing SERP visibility, and conducting competitive research.

          <p>Lenovo redefines flexibility and efficiency for Artificial Intelligence (AI) at the edge with the first-to-market, entry-level AI inferencing server - designed to make edge AI accessible and affordable for SMBs and enterprises alike. Showcased as part of a full-stack of cost-effective, sustainable, and scalable hybrid AI solutions at MWC25, the Lenovo ThinkEdge SE100 bridges the gap between client and edge servers to deliver enterprise-level intelligence for every business and is a critical link to enabling AI capabilities for all environments.



Lenovo continues to deliver on its mission of enabling smarter AI for all by making implementation feasible for every business, in every industry with infrastructure that goes beyond traditional data center architecture to bring AI to the data. Rather than sending the data to the cloud to be processed, edge computing uses devices located at the data source, reducing latency so businesses can make faster decisions and solve challenges in real time.

By 2030, the edge market is projected to grow at an annual rate of nearly 37%. Lenovo is leading this moment with the industry's broadest portfolio of edge computing infrastructure and over a million edge systems shipped globally, achieving 13 consecutive quarters of growth in edge revenue while expanding AI computing's reach.



"Lenovo is committed to bringing AI-powered innovation to everyone with continued innovation that simplifies deployment and speeds the time to results," said Scott Tease, Vice President of Lenovo Infrastructure Solutions Group, Products. "The Lenovo ThinkEdge SE100 is a high-performance, low-latency platform for inferencing. Its compact and cost-effective design is easily tailored to diverse business needs across a broad range of industries. This unique, purpose-driven system adapts to any environment, seamlessly scaling from a base device, to a GPU-optimized system that enables easy-to-deploy, low-cost inferencing at the edge."



AI Inferencing Performance Designed for Life at the Edge

The new AI inferencing server is 85% smaller and 100 percent powerful. Meeting customers where they are, it redefines edge AI with powerful, scalable, and versatile performance that accelerates ROI. Despite a three-fold spend increase, recent global IDC research commissioned by Lenovo reveals ROI remains the greatest AI adoption barrier. Adaptable for desktops, wall-mounts, ceilings, and 1U racks, the SE100 is engineered to be uniquely affordable, breaking price barriers with AI inferencing performance that supports better business outcomes while lowering costs.



As the most compact, AI-ready edge solution on the market, the Lenovo ThinkEdge SE100 is perfect for constrained spaces without compromising performance and answers customer demand for accelerated AI-level compute that can go anywhere. The breakthrough server delivers enterprise-level, whisper quiet performance with enhanced security features in a design that is GPU-ready for AI workloads, like real-time inferencing, video analytics and object detection across telco, retail, industrial and manufacturing environments.



The ThinkEdge SE100 maximizes performance in an AI-ready server, evolving from a base device to an industrial grade, GPU-optimized solution as the end user sees fit. The ThinkEdge SE100 can be equipped with up to six or eight performance cores, ensuring the device's power is maximized in a smaller footprint.



Edge AI Inferencing in Action

Across industries, the inferencing server is designed for low latency and workload consolidation, supporting hybrid cloud deployments and machine learning for AI tasks like object detection and text recognition, all while maintaining data security. The ThinkEdge SE100's rugged design includes dust filtering and tamper protection, to give peace of mind for utilization in real-world environments. Robust security controls, including USB port disabling and disk encryption, serve to protect sensitive data from outside threats.



"Together, Lenovo and Scale Computing are delivering innovative, enterprise-grade solutions to customers worldwide. Leveraging the ThinkEdge SE100, we are bringing together Lenovo's industry-leading hardware reliability with Scale Computing's proven edge software to create a purpose-built HCI solution for AI at the edge," said Jeff Ready, CEO and co-founder of Scale Computing. "With its compact, power-efficient design and enterprise-class performance, the ThinkEdge SE100 is redefining how businesses of all sizes deploy scalable, resilient infrastructure in the most demanding environments. This latest innovation reflects Lenovo's leadership in edge-AI computing and our shared commitment to bringing the future of intelligent, AI-powered infrastructure to businesses now."



Retailers can leverage the innovation to power inventory and associate management or support loss prevention at self-checkout. Manufacturers can leverage the SE100 to power quality assurance capabilities and warehouse monitoring. Healthcare professionals can equip remote offices with a ThinkEdge SE100 server to power process automation, handling lab data and ensuring back-office efficiency. Finally, the ThinkEdge SE100 can be used by energy companies in gas stations and refineries, helping with power logistics and smart meters.



Enabling New Levels of Efficiency and Scalability

Lenovo's Open Cloud Automation (LOC-A) and a Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) built into the device eliminate traditional deployment difficulties for seamless installations. Deployment costs are reduced by up to 47%, and users experience both resource and time savings of up to 60%. After deployment, the ThinkEdge SE100 also provides ease of management through Lenovo's latest version of XClarity, which centralizes monitoring, configuration and troubleshooting infrastructure in a single pane of glass.



Lenovo ThinkEdge SE100 supports robust AI performance without compromising energy efficiency to optimize total cost of ownership and support sustainability commitments. The SE100's system power is designed to stay under 140W even in its fullest GPU-equipped configuration, supporting lower power consumption. Additionally, Lenovo's energy-saving implementations reduce overall carbon emissions of the ThinkEdge SE100 by up to 84%. This starts before the device is even turned on, thanks to a 90% EPE packaging design that cuts its transportation footprint. Design elements, like a new low-temperature solder and post-consumer recycled content along with Lenovo's Product End-Of-Life (PELM) program, also support a transition to a circular economy.



Across its full-stack hybrid AI portfolio, Lenovo delivers powerful, adaptable, and responsible AI solutions to transform industries and empower individuals with innovations that enable Smarter AI for all. The SE100 is part of the new ThinkSystem V4 Servers Powered by Intel Xeon 6 Processors, which also extend Lenovo Neptune liquid cooling from the CPU to the memory with the new Neptune Core Compute Complex Module. The module supports faster workloads with reduced fan speeds, quieter operation and lower power consumption. It is specifically engineered to reduce air flow requirements, yielding lower fan speeds and power consumption while also keeping the parts cooler for improved system health and lifespan.</p>
