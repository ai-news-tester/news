          <p>The Nasdaq 100 Index sank into a correction on Friday, as investors continue to sour on the megacap technology stocks that led the stock market rally over the past two years.

The index is now 10.2% below a peak hit just last month, putting it past the 10% threshold that represents a market correction. Among notable decliners, Nvidia slid 0.7%, Amazon.com fell 1.5% and Microsoft 1.9%. The Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Total Return Index, which entered a correction of its own in late February, 1.1% on Friday.

Much of the slump reflects Wall Street’s rapid rotation out of companies tied to artificial intelligence. Since the Nasdaq 100 hit a record high on 19 February, Nvidia has lost more than a fifth of its value and is responsible for 18% of the index’s overall decline, according to data up to Thursday’s close. Other notable decliners since that peak include Tesla, Apple, Palantir Technologies, Meta Platforms and Amazon.com.

Earnings were pretty good for Big Tech this past quarter, but I’m not sure they’ll get much better from here

“Over the past few years, the Magnificent Seven have done exceptionally well, and they deserved the premium they were trading at because of how well they were growing their top and bottom lines,” said George Cipolloni, a portfolio manager at Penn Mutual Asset Management. “That has sort of changed. Earnings were pretty good for Big Tech this past quarter, but I’m not sure they’ll get much better from here, and there’s only so much a company can grow at these multiples.”

While investors remain broadly optimistic about the long-term potential of AI, this earnings season failed to show the kind of growth or profitability many investors had hoped for. That has raised further questions about Big Tech’s strategy of pouring tens of billions of dollars into AI-related expenditure with little to show so far.

Sky-high multiples

In addition, there’s new scrutiny on the group’s sky-high equity multiples, which reflected stronger growth trends than are now expected. And AI developments out of China — with companies claiming strong performance with less cost and fewer high-powered chips — are further clouding the outlook.

With the Nasdaq 100 more than doubling from the start of 2023 to its latest all-time high, it was a natural place for investors to take profits. But more broadly, a cloudy backdrop — marked by a weakening US economy, trade wars and rising geopolitical tensions — is creating a general risk-off mood in the stock market. The S&P 500 Index is down 7.2% from its peak, which also came on 19 February.

“There’s now so much uncertainty that valuations are being compressed across the board,” Cipolloni said. “Enthusiasm has gotten taken out of risk assets in general. The backdrop has become really problematic, and all this uncertainty really hurts.” — (c) 2025 Bloomberg LP

The Department of Justice (DOJ) is no longer demanding that Google sell its investments in artificial intelligence (AI) startups, but remains committed to forcing the company to divest its Chrome browser as part of a sweeping antitrust remedy.

In a proposal filed on March 7, the DOJ and a coalition of 38 state attorneys general urged the federal court in Washington to order Google to sell Chrome and implement measures to dismantle what a judge ruled was an illegal internet search monopoly.

The proposal says Google must “promptly and fully divest Chrome, along with any assets or services necessary” to complete the sale to a buyer approved by the plaintiffs. In addition, Google would be required to stop paying partners for preferential search engine placement and notify regulators before entering any joint ventures or partnerships with search or search-ad competitors.

However, antitrust enforcers dropped an earlier demand that Google divest its AI investments, saying such a move could have “unintended consequences in the evolving AI space.” Google must still provide prior notice of future AI investments.

“Through its sheer size and unrestricted power, Google has robbed consumers and businesses of a fundamental promise owed to the public—their right to choose among competing services,” states a summary of the DOJ’s proposal. “Google’s illegal conduct has created an economic goliath, one that wreaks havoc over the marketplace to ensure that—no matter what occurs—Google always wins.”

The DOJ first sued Google in 2020, marking the biggest U.S. tech antitrust case since its battle against Microsoft in the 1990s. The lawsuit alleged that Google used anticompetitive tactics to maintain its dominance, securing contracts that made it the default search engine on web browsers and smartphones.

This dominant position, regulators said, allows Google to manipulate its ad auction system, raising costs for advertisers while boosting its own revenue.

Google, which has long held nearly 90 percent of the U.S. search market, says its dominance stems from superior service. The company argues that users can easily switch search engines and that it still faces competition from Microsoft’s Bing and others.

In August 2024, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta of the District of Columbia ruled that Google illegally maintained a monopoly over general online search services and some of the ads that run in search results. He pointed to Google’s lucrative contracts with device makers and browser partners, noting that nearly 70 percent of all general search queries in the United States flow through Chrome and other portals that default to Google.

“Many users do not know that there is a default search engine, what it is, or that it can be changed,” the ruling stated.

Following the ruling, the DOJ submitted a set of proposed remedies in November 2024, outlining the steps it believes are necessary to weaken Google’s grip on the search market.

The proposal calls for Google to sell off Chrome and, potentially, divest Android. It also seeks to end Google’s lucrative search partnership with Apple, which brings the iPhone maker billions of dollars each year in exchange for making Google the default search engine in Safari.

Additionally, the DOJ wants to give competitors access to Google’s data—for both search and ads—“that would otherwise provide Google an ongoing advantage from its exclusionary conduct.”

Google has pushed back against the DOJ’s demands, calling the proposal a “radical interventionist agenda” that extends far beyond the court’s ruling. The company warns that breaking apart its products would not only disrupt its search business but could also harm “America’s global technological leadership.”

In a counterproposal submitted in December 2024, Google proposed allowing multiple default search engine agreements across different devices, meaning that iPhone and iPad might feature different default search engines.

The company also offered to limit search revenue deals with hardware manufacturers to one-year contracts instead of long-term agreements and to give Android phone makers more flexibility when it comes to search and Chrome.

Mehta will hear arguments for the two proposals in April.</p>
