      <p class="card-text">At this year’s Oscars, there is a subplot of controversy over the use of artificial intelligence in the production of a number of nominated films, including some in the running for best picture. Katey Rich, awards editor at The Ankler and host of the podcast …</p>

Well, I think the important thing about "The Brutalist" is that the actors Adrian Brody and Felicity Jones, whose voices were used for that, it was done with their permission. They own the models of their voices. So it's not like by having done this that they are voiced voices can be replaced by a computer version of them, which was one of the big sticking points in the strikes last year with the actors of saying they don't want a computer to just replace them without their actual permission.

And I think there is discussion now inside the academy about the ways that these productions can disclose whether or not they used AI. There's been no official ruling on that. And I think as this technology evolves, it will maybe be harder to tell what's AI and what's not or how useful a disclosure in.

If this is a technology that's growing so quickly, it's going to have to change every year and assess what's people's comfort levels are. I think it's going to evolve a lot in the coming years.</p>
