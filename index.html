          <p>Amazon is one of the top investors in artificial intelligence (AI) startup Anthropic.

However, the company says there is no truth to reports that Anthropic’s AI model is powering the most advanced capabilities of its new Alexa devices.

Sources had told CNBC Friday (Feb. 28) that Anthropic’s Claude large language model was handling most of the questions that customers have been asking the new Alexa, which last week received a long-promised upgrade.

Amazon contends information in the CNBC report is “false,” the network said.

“In fact, over the past four weeks Nova handled over 70% of conversations — including complex requests,” an Amazon spokesperson wrote in an email, referring to the company’s in-house AI model. “That said, from a customer perspective this doesn’t matter — both are excellent models and in there to deliver the best experience for customers.”

As PYMNTS wrote last week, the revamped Alexa “is infused with generative artificial intelligence to be more capable, conversational and agentic than the old version.”

Dubbed Alexa+, Amazon says this iteration of the voice assistant can carry out activities like ordering groceries, calling an Uber, or finding and booking a repairman. It can also send text messages, go to websites and complete tasks for users through Alexa.com and a new phone app, the company said during the launch.

Alexa+, that report noted, had been plagued by delays, with news accounts of it hallucinating or providing wrong information on test questions. The unveiling comes around a year and a half after Amazon first announced it was going to infuse AI into Alexa.

“Up until a couple years ago, it was pretty difficult to invent with AI, and that changed with the arrival of foundational models and generative AI. This made the technology much more accessible, so people can see the power and magic of what generative AI can do,” said Amazon CEO Andy Jassy.

In a separate report last week, PYMNTS wrote that the new Alexa aligns with past PYMNTS Intelligence research into voice-controlled devices.

“The next frontier is approaching … and nearly two-thirds of Americans have already used this up-and-coming technology in the past year,” the report said. “This advancement, of course, is voice technology.

“Consumers want to make everyday routines smart, simple and more connected, and hands-free voice technologies can fit the bill. Consumers can already use voice technology to find information, identify themselves via voice assistant, or find and book airline tickets, among other possibilities.”</p>

          <p>Katey Rich:

Well, I think the important thing about "The Brutalist" is that the actors Adrian Brody and Felicity Jones, whose voices were used for that, it was done with their permission. They own the models of their voices. So it's not like by having done this that they are voiced voices can be replaced by a computer version of them, which was one of the big sticking points in the strikes last year with the actors of saying they don't want a computer to just replace them without their actual permission.

And I think there is discussion now inside the academy about the ways that these productions can disclose whether or not they used AI. There's been no official ruling on that. And I think as this technology evolves, it will maybe be harder to tell what's AI and what's not or how useful a disclosure in.

If this is a technology that's growing so quickly, it's going to have to change every year and assess what's people's comfort levels are. I think it's going to evolve a lot in the coming years.</p>
