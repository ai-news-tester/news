          <p>He said he did not want to be alarmist about artificial intelligence (AI) adding to a cyber attacker’s arsenal, however, it did make cyber warfare more accessible.

“The way AI is working out in cyber attacks is simply it’s making them a fair bit better, but also it’s making them cheaper and easier to do.

“And this is the bit I worry about right now.

“I think it’s a real potential source of quite acute pain globally, because somebody we’ve not heard of before as a major cyber actor just says right, ‘AI is my ticket to the global cyber hacking campaign’.”

Watch Martin discuss how the Five Eyes handles cyber threats, including from state-sponsored attackers, and what businesses can do to protect against it, in today’s episode of Markets with Madison above.

AI in Cancer Diagnostics Overview

AI is revolutionizing cancer diagnostics by enhancing accuracy, speed, and efficiency in disease detection. Machine learning algorithms can analyze vast amounts of medical imaging data—such as CT scans, MRIs, and histopathology slides—with a precision that rivals or even surpasses human radiologists. Deep learning models trained on extensive datasets can identify subtle patterns and anomalies that may be overlooked by traditional methods, enabling earlier detection of cancers like lung, breast, and skin cancer. AI-powered tools also assist in automating routine tasks, reducing diagnostic errors, and supporting personalized treatment planning based on predictive analytics.

Beyond imaging, AI is also transforming molecular and genomic diagnostics. AI-driven models can analyze complex genetic and biomarker data to predict cancer risk, treatment response, and prognosis. This is particularly valuable in precision oncology, where targeted therapies are tailored to a patient’s unique genetic profile. AI is also being integrated into liquid biopsy techniques, allowing for non-invasive cancer detection through blood samples. Additionally, natural language processing (NLP) enables AI to extract critical insights from unstructured medical records, improving clinical decision-making. As AI continues to evolve, it holds immense promise for making cancer diagnostics faster, more accessible, and highly individualized.
