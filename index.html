Jimmy Kimmel found an unflattering analysis of President Donald Trump and his relationship with Russia from an unexpected source: Grok, the artificial intelligence tool on social media platform X that’s backed by Elon Musk.

Musk and his so-called Department of Government Efficiency, Kimmel noted, have reportedly been using AI in their attempts to fire thousands of federal employees as they look to dramatically shrink government departments and agencies.

But Kimmel spotted a report that Musk’s own tool doesn’t seem to think very highly of Trump himself.

That came from Arizona Republic columnist EJ Montini, who wrote that he asked Grok:

What is the likelihood from 1-100 that Trump is a Putin-compromised asset? Use all publicly available information from 1980 on and his failure to ever say anything negative about Putin but has no issue attacking allies.

Grok estimated 75% to 85% likelihood that “Trump is a Putin-compromised asset, leaning toward the higher end” of that range.

“Well, if that’s good enough to fire somebody, Grok him up,” Kimmel said. “Because 85% is very high.”
