Besides Scale AI, the Thunderforge system will also include defense company Anduril’s Lattice open software platform, and LLM technology by Microsoft (MSFT-1.51% ).

The Department has been working to get AI capabilities into defense operations since 2021, including through the use of autonomous weapons and AI-powered computer vision to identify airstrike targets.

But Thunderforge is its first significant step into giving AI a more prominent role in operational decision-making across the military by integrating large language models, dubbed AI agents, in its workflows. AI will be used in military campaign development and resource allocation, wargaming simulations, planning scenarios and proposed courses of action, and strategic assessments.

U.S. Central Command’s chief tech officer Schuyler Moore told Bloomberg in 2024 that Centcom had experimented with AI recommendation engines in late 2023 and found that it “frequently fell short” of humans when proposing orders of attack.

The Department will first deploy the system within the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM), out of Hawaii, and the U.S. European Command (EUCOM), based in Germany, before scaling it across the rest of the eleven combatant commands.

Humans will oversee the AI agents, Scale AI shared in a press release on Wednesday, but that has not quelled worries over the technology being deployed in certain fields.

“We all probably suffer from automation bias, which is this idea that we are tempted to and often will accept the recommendation, for example, that a large language model spits out or prediction that one of these systems is making, because we feel as though the system must have more information than we do, and must be processing it and sequencing it and ordering it better than we could,” legal scholar and former associate White House counsel Ashley Deeks told Quartz.

What exacerbates the problem even more is that AI systems are like “black boxes,” according to Deeks, in that it is tough for users to understand how or why it reaches certain conclusions.

“I hope that the Pentagon itself is thinking about how to train people to resist excessive automation bias when their gut and their experience has told them to do ‘x’ and the system is telling them to do ‘y’,” Deeks said.

Scale AI CEO and founder Alexandr Wang has been praising the merits of AI-assisted warfare for some time now. Wang took out a full page ad in the Washington Post asking President Donald Trump to invest more to “win the AI war” in January, and then defended his opinion later during a February summit in Qatar, where he said he is concerned that China will use AI to “leapfrog” the military capacity of “Western powers.” China has reportedly made AI military power a strategic priority, although some experts believe Beijing still faces significant obstacles in taking full advantage of the technology.

A number of militaries around the world have used AI to assist their military operations and identify targets, most notably Israel in its war in Gaza, and by both sides of the Russia-Ukraine war.</p>

          <p>Discover how artificial intelligence is shaping the future of workplace management, from optimizing efficiency to enhancing employee experience. Explore the evolving role of AI in transforming workplace operations and strategies for smarter, more effective decision-making.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming nearly every aspect of business operations, and workplace management is no exception. The integration of AI into workplace management brings a range of benefits, from optimizing office space to improving employee productivity and engagement. However, it also introduces several challenges that organizations must address to ensure a smooth transition and successful implementation.

The benefits of AI in workplace management

AI can significantly improve workplace efficiency by automating routine tasks, such as scheduling, resource allocation, and inventory management. By removing these repetitive and time-consuming activities from employees’ workloads, AI allows them to focus on more critical tasks, ultimately boosting productivity across the organization.

For instance, AI-driven meeting room booking systems can automatically allocate rooms based on team size, equipment requirements, and availability, ensuring seamless operations. For those wondering, what is workplace management? It refers to the strategic approach of optimizing workplace resources, processes, and technology to create a more efficient and productive work environment.

AI: the brain behind modern workplace decision-making

With the ability to analyze vast amounts of data in real-time, AI can help managers make informed, data-driven decisions. For example, AI-powered workplace analytics tools can provide insights into employee performance, space utilization, and overall operational efficiency. These insights allow managers to identify trends, improve resource allocation, and optimize workflows, ensuring that both employees and resources are used to their full potential.

Personalized Employee Experience: AI is capable of creating a personalized work environment for employees by understanding individual preferences and needs. By analyzing data on work patterns, preferences, and behaviours, AI can suggest customized solutions for improving employee productivity, wellness, and satisfaction. From automatically adjusting room lighting and temperature based on preferences to offering personalized workspaces and task prioritization, AI can tailor the workplace to enhance the overall employee experience.

Cost Savings and Resource Optimization: AI helps organizations optimize resource utilization, reducing waste and inefficiencies. By utilizing predictive analytics, businesses can better forecast demand for resources, such as meeting rooms, office equipment, and even parking spaces. As a result, companies can minimize costs associated with underutilized assets and improve overall space management. AI-driven energy management systems can also help cut down on energy consumption by adjusting lighting, heating, and cooling systems based on occupancy and weather patterns.

The challenges of AI in workplace management

One of the biggest challenges when integrating AI into workplace management is ensuring data privacy and security. AI systems rely on large volumes of data to function effectively, and this data often includes sensitive information about employees and business operations. Without proper safeguards in place, there is a risk of data breaches and privacy violations. Organizations must implement robust cybersecurity protocols and ensure compliance with data protection regulations to mitigate these risks.

Resistance to change

Implementing AI solutions in the workplace may encounter resistance from employees who are sceptical about the technology or concerned about job security. Employees may fear that AI will replace human workers, leading to a decline in morale and productivity. To overcome this resistance, organizations must focus on education and training, helping employees understand the benefits of AI and how it can support their work rather than replace it.

Integration with existing systems

Integrating AI into existing workplace management systems can be complex and time-consuming. Many organizations rely on legacy systems that may not be compatible with AI technologies. This can lead to difficulties in data transfer, system integration, and operational disruptions. Organizations must carefully plan their AI implementation strategy, ensuring that they invest in systems that integrate seamlessly with their current infrastructure to avoid costly delays and technical challenges.

Bias and Fairness in AI

AI algorithms are only as good as the data they are trained on, and if that data is biased, the AI system may produce biased results. For example, AI-driven employee performance management tools could inadvertently favour certain groups over others if the data used to train the system reflects biases related to gender, race, or other factors. To address this, organizations must ensure that the data used to train AI models is diverse and representative and that AI systems are regularly audited for fairness and accuracy.

The next frontier: AI in workplace management

As AI continues to evolve, its role in workplace management will only expand. Future AI systems will be even more sophisticated, with the potential to transform how employees interact with their work environment. AI-powered tools will become more intuitive, anticipating needs before they arise and offering proactive solutions.

However, for AI to achieve its full potential, organizations must ensure that they are prepared to address the challenges outlined above. By focusing on transparency, employee engagement, and data privacy, businesses can unlock the full benefits of AI while mitigating the associated risks. As AI technology becomes increasingly integrated into workplace management systems, it promises to create smarter, more efficient, and more personalized work environments that benefit both employees and organizations alike.

Conclusion

AI is revolutionizing workplace management by improving efficiency, enhancing decision-making, and optimizing resource utilization. While the benefits are clear, organizations must also be mindful of the challenges, such as data privacy, employee resistance, and system integration.

By carefully navigating these challenges, businesses can successfully harness the power of AI to create smarter, more efficient, and more productive workplaces. As AI technology continues to advance, the future of workplace management looks promising, offering exciting possibilities for organizations that embrace it.</p>

Researchers at the Fritz Haber Institute have developed the Automatic Process Explorer (APE), an approach that enhances our understanding of atomic and molecular processes. By dynamically refining simulations, APE has uncovered unexpected complexities in the oxidation of palladium (Pd) surfaces, offering new insights into catalyst behavior. The study is published in the journal Physical Review Letters.

Kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations are essential for studying the long-term evolution of atomic and molecular processes. They are widely used in fields like surface catalysis, where reactions on material surfaces are crucial for developing efficient catalysts that accelerate reactions in energy production and pollution control. Traditional kMC simulations rely on predefined inputs, which can limit their ability to capture complex atomic movements. This is where the Automatic Process Explorer (APE) comes in.

Developed by the Theory Department at the Fritz Haber Institute, APE overcomes biases in traditional kMC simulations by dynamically updating the list of processes based on the system's current state. This approach encourages exploration of new structures, promoting diversity and efficiency in structural exploration. APE separates process exploration from kMC simulations, using fuzzy machine-learning classification to identify distinct atomic environments. This allows for a broader exploration of potential atomic movements.

By integrating APE with machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs), researchers applied it to the early-stage oxidation of palladium surfaces, a key system in pollution control. When applied to the early-stage oxidation of a palladium surface, a key material used in catalytic converters for cars to reduce emissions, APE uncovered nearly 3,000 processes, far exceeding the capabilities of traditional kMC simulations. These findings reveal complex atomic motions and restructuring processes that occur on timescales similar to molecular processes in catalysis.

The APE methodology provides a detailed understanding of Pd surface restructuring during oxidation, revealing complexities previously unseen. This research enhances our knowledge of nanostructure evolution and its role in surface catalysis. By improving the efficiency of catalysts, these insights have the potential to significantly impact energy production and environmental protection, contributing to cleaner technologies and more sustainable industrial processes.
