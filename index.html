Imagine a world where a child is raised exclusively by artificial intelligence. AI “parents” provide unwavering patience, guidance, and unconditional support. AI friends are always available, never moody, and never hold grudges. AI teachers offer infinite knowledge and patience. Even AI romantic partners are effortlessly responsive and perfectly attuned to their desires.

In this world, social interactions are frictionless. There are few misunderstandings, little emotional unpredictability, and few conflicts to navigate. Every interaction is designed to meet the human’s needs—on demand, with low effort.

At first glance, this might seem like an ideal scenario: no rejection, no emotional labor, no wasted energy figuring out what others need. But what happens when this AI-raised individual steps into the real world—where human relationships are messy, unpredictable, and require more effort?

The paradox is that while AI relationships and companionship may seem to solve many of our productivity, efficiency, and interpersonal struggles, they may also leave us less equipped for real human relationships. AI systems could be designed to mimic human conflict and portray the unpredictability of human emotions, but this might undermine their original purpose and the lack of a real human "other" may still change social expectations.

AI Systems Are Increasingly in Social Roles

One in four young adults believe AI could replace human-to-human romantic relationships. One in ten is open to having an AI friend. As artificial intelligence expands into roles traditionally fulfilled by humans—assistants, coaches, therapists, consultants, tutors, even romantic partners—our social expectations and norms will likely change.

A recent paper in AI and Ethics calls for deeper research into the evolving psychology of human–AI relationships. How will human-AI interactions change our ability to connect with each other?

1. Emotional Attachment and Dependence

Will people who form deep attachments to AI have trouble navigating real-world relationships?

Human interactions require compromise, patience, and the ability to tolerate discomfort. In contrast, AI interactions are often designed to be seamless. AI systems do not withdraw affection and do not require any support in return. Over time, this could create unrealistic expectations that interpersonal dynamics should be effortless, leading to frustration or avoidance when dealing with the messiness and imperfections of human connection. People may also become more withdrawn and less likely to reach out to humans since their emotional needs are fulfilled by AI. Emotional connections may become more superficial, transactional, or imbalanced.

2. AI and the Loneliness Debate

Can AI truly reduce loneliness, or does it merely mask it?

Some studies suggest that AI companions could help combat social isolation, particularly for older adults. However, a 2024 survey found that 69 percent of older adults did not believe AI companionship would make them feel less lonely. Nearly 70 percent of participants also expressed high levels of discomfort with the idea that people might be allowed to believe that AI relationships are real human relationships, for example, in cases where people suffering from dementia may believe the AI companion is human.

AI can provide engagement and conversation, but it lacks genuine reciprocity and emotional presence. Loneliness is not just about the absence of interaction—it’s about the absence of meaningful authentic connection. If AI replaces, rather than supplements, human relationships, it may deepen isolation rather than relieve it. Outsourcing human companionship to AI also raises ethical questions, especially if the person is not aware that it is AI.

3. Distorted Social Expectations

Organizational psychologist Adam Grant describes three types of people in relationships: givers, takers, and matchers. Many AI systems are designed to be primarily givers—their sole function is to fulfill human needs. This requires low effort on our part, no reciprocity, no emotional attunement. If we become accustomed to interactions where our needs are always met without question, we will likely not have as much patience for relationships that require reciprocity. Will we unconsciously expect humans to behave like AI and become more disappointed when humans fall short? Will we struggle to invest effort in human relationships? If we stop thanking AI for its help, will we become less polite to humans in similar roles?

Studies on digital communication and social media have shown that constant exposure to instant gratification (such as immediate text replies or algorithmically optimized content feeds) reduces our patience and tolerance for ambiguity. One 2013 study found that people are patient for up to 2 seconds. This has likely shortened in the last decade. AI could accelerate this effect—conditioning us to expect quick, effortless, conflict-free interactions that do not reflect real human experiences.

4. Empathy Atrophy: The Hidden Cost of AI Interactions

Empathy is a skill that is developed through real-life social interactions. It requires us to mentalize, or put ourselves in another person’s mind, recognizing their thoughts, emotions, and perspectives. What happens if our primary interactions are with AI—an entity with no true feelings, needs, or perspectives of its own? Over time, this dynamic could erode our ability to be emotionally present and aware of others.

AI can be trained to respond in ways that cause it to convey more "emotion" and even build in ways to prompt empathy from the user. But many current AI systems whose purpose is to fulfill human needs are not trained to express negative emotions like frustration, disappointment, judgment, or dismay.

Over time, one-sided interactions with AI systems that are designed to cater to us may dull our ability to recognize and respond to the emotional needs of others, leading to "empathy atrophy."

The Future of Human-AI Relationships

The long-term impact of human–AI relationships on our social dynamics is currently unknown. AI systems are enhancing our lives in many ways, but how they are designed and integrated will evolve our social norms and expectations. The challenge ahead is understanding how human-AI interactions will shape us.
