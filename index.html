          <p>KUALA LUMPUR: Mastering artificial intelligence (AI) will be a key factor in increasing the productivity of the local labour force, which is a prerequisite to raising local wages, says Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim.

Anwar said productivity of the labour force could be enhanced by upskilling programmes, the introduction of new subjects such as AI, new technology and among others.

“Ai is a challenging approach and even though we have a clear policy, its mastery is limited.

“So, instructions have been given to all research centres, including schools and universities, to give emphasis (on AI).

“I am of the opinion that the mastery of AI will determine whether or not Malaysia has the ability to raise its productivity,” said Anwar during Prime Minister’s Question Time in Parliament on Tuesday (March 4).

According to Anwar, that is why it is compulsory for some new foreign companies to set up centers of excellence in Malaysia as a condition to operate in the country.

“This is a condition for Nvidia, Microsoft, Google and Infineon,” added Anwar.

Anwar was responding to a supplementary question raised by Syed Saddiq Syed Abdul Rahman (Muda-Muar), who asked if there were plans by the government to raise wages and productivity of the labour force.

According to Syed Saddiq, Malaysia allocated about 0.8% of its GDP to research and development (R&D), which is lagging behind Singapore (2.2%).

Earlier, Anwar said that companies which made significant profits should ensure that their workers are paid fairly.

“Don’t record huge profits but pay your workers inadequately. There is a gap where productivity increases are not matched with wage increases, and inflation will affect them.

“We are taking steps (to address this),” said Anwar.

Meanwhile, Anwar also said the Malaysian economy had recorded growth of 5.1% last year, which is considered as among the highest in the region.

“Do these positive figures benefit the people? The answer is yes.

“It created 120,000 new jobs and the unemployment rate was at 3.1% as of Dec last year,” said Anwar.

The Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) had said last year that Malaysia’s economy growth in the fourth quarter of 2024 was mainly driven by continued expansion in the services, manufacturing and construction sectors.</p>

          <p>BARCELONA: OPPO announced its enhanced artificial intelligence (AI) strategy, positioning itself as a leader in AI experiences by delivering comprehensive, secure and continuously evolving AI solutions at OPPO AI Tech Summit during MWC2025.

“When it comes to AI, the user experience is ultimately all that matters,” said OPPO overseas marketing, sales and services president Billy Zhang.

“Smartphones are not just a vehicle for AI – they are the engines that power the best possible AI experiences.

As a global leader in smartphones, OPPO is driving in-house innovation and open collaboration with industry partners to bring our users these unparalleled AI experiences.”

As applications of AI continue to evolve, OPPO is advancing its AI experience from functional-level to system-level AI. This in turn is placing new demands on the extent of AI integration and security required on devices.

OPPO is further integrating Google AI experiences across its smartphones and Google Gemini can soon take action across native OPPO apps, such as Notes, Calendar, and Clock. These new capabilities will work alongside existing support for Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.5 Flash on OPPO AI Phones to unlock unprecedented levels of performance and responsiveness.

The two companies are working closely to bring the latest Gemini 2.0 to OPPO Phones soon.

To protect user security and privacy when accessing these deeply embedded AI features, OPPO is also implementing Private Computing Cloud (PCC) built with confidential computing from Google Cloud. Starting from AI Recording Summary, AI features including AI Search, AI Studio, AI Call Summary will be integrated with OPPO Private Computing Cloud this year.

“We are excited to collaborate with OPPO to shape the future of mobile AI by bringing together Google technologies with OPPO’s exceptional hardware and software,” said Google Cloud global solution and consumer AI managing director Matt Waldbusser.

“Through our extensive partnership spanning apps, AI models and cloud solutions, we are unlocking immense potential to redefine the mobile AI experience.”

Under its latest AI development strategy, OPPO is focusing on the three core areas of AI Productivity, AI Creativity, and AI Imaging to deliver meaningful features that will make AI an essential part of users’ everyday lives.

Underlying these three pillars is a comprehensive AI R and D strategy that covers the entire AI ecosystem – from chips and devices to the cloud.

OPPO is working closely with MediaTek to optimise chips for high-efficiency, real-time AI processing that enables powerful performance without compromising energy efficiency.

MediaTek wireless business group deputy general manager Will Chen said, “The partnership between MediaTek and OPPO is set to unlock new opportunities in AI. From AI-enhanced photography to next-generation gaming experiences, from intelligent security solutions to seamless device connectivity, the possibilities are limitless.”

On the device side, AI technologies like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), Parallel Decoding

Solution, and MoE (Mixture of Experts) are significantly boosting the performance of AI capabilities on OPPO devices. On the cloud, OPPO has built a comprehensive data security protection system that works across devices and the cloud.

Reaching more users with more features faster than ever

As AI technology and applications continue to develop, OPPO is evolving its own approach to redefine how AI enhances everyday experiences.

After surpassing its goal of reaching 50 million users last year, OPPO now aims to double that, expecting nearly 100 million users by the end of this year.

To meet users’ growing demand, OPPO will deliver an average of one new AI update per month. New AI innovations like AI Search and integration of OPPO applications with Google Gemini are coming to the OPPO Find N5 soon.

AI Call Translator, which interprets calls in multiple languages in real-time and AI VoiceScribe, offering multi-use voice summarization across voice calls, online learning, and meetings, are coming to OPPO devices via a future update.</p>

          <p>SINGAPORE: With the rapid proliferation of websites used for scams and other malicious cyber activities, the government is considering how to harness technology to autonomously disrupt these more rapidly, said Second Minister for Home Affairs Josephine Teo on Tuesday (Mar 4).

“We will continue to review our laws, to ensure their ability to deal with traditional crimes committed in cyberspace, and strengthen our regulatory frameworks, to better leverage technology to combat cybercrimes,” she added, while laying out the ministry’s spending plans for the year.

Mrs Teo, who is also Minister for Digital Development and Information, said in parliament that the threat landscape was increasingly complex.

“Criminals are exploiting technology, in particular, artificial intelligence (AI), to carry out more sophisticated crimes and to hit more victims,” she said.

A Scam Analytics and Tactical Intervention System (SATIS), jointly developed by GovTech and the Home Team’s science and technology agency HTX, is an existing example of how scam sites are hunted down and disrupted using AI and machine learning.

It goes beyond impersonated government websites to include bank phishing sites, sites hosting malware and those used in impersonation scams.

In a separate speech later on Tuesday, Minister of State for Home Affairs and Social and Family Development Sun Xueling revealed that SATIS would be expanded to disrupt other scam enablers such as payment channels and mobile numbers.

Mrs Teo said the Home Team has been leveraging technology in its work, particularly in using AI to combat AI-driven crime.

Its AI Movement was launched last year by HTX, to develop new AI capabilities across its various agencies.

HTX will hire and train 300 people for an AI workforce by the end of this year, she said. Some of its AI solutions have already been rolled out.

For instance, the Singapore Civil Defence Force's targeted on-site inspection tool uses AI to assess the likelihood of fire safety violations in commercial and industrial premises, using data such as past inspection reports.

The tool will be progressively rolled out to all frontline units for field testing in coming months, Mrs Teo said.

The Home Team is also leveraging smart and autonomous solutions to detect threats earlier, said Mrs Teo.

The Singapore Prison Service (SPS), for instance, is trialling the use of smart sensors in its medical wards and cells, to monitor inmates’ vital signs remotely.

As the SPS faces a growing pool of older inmates, the new system lets officers respond more quickly to incidents such as falls and abnormal heart rates among the inmates.</p>
