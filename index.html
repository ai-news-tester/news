          <p>Audiomodern’s flagship software, Playbeat 4, uses AI-powered, genre-based pattern generation and a refined new GUI. But does it still rank among the best sequencers out there?

Artificial Intelligence has revolutionized industries across the board, and music production is no exception. While AI often sparks scepticism — cue the usual eye-rolls about robots taking over —developers are flipping the script by using it to enhance, not replace, human creativity. Instead of automating inspiration out of the process, AI-driven tools are putting more power in the hands of artists. A prime example is Audiomodern’s latest genre-focused update in Playbeat 4, designed to streamline workflow and spark new ideas. So, can we finally shift the conversation from fear to creative freedom?

When we reviewed Playbeat 3 back in 2022, we confidently called it “a contender for the only software random-sequence generator you need.” Its strength lay in its ability to capture ideas that might otherwise be lost, its sleek and intuitive interface, and the endless pattern variations made possible by its remixing capabilities.

Fast-forward three years, and Audiomodern has expanded on its foundation with Playbeat 4. The latest version introduces an AI-powered, genre-based pattern generator, a complexity slider, and an innovative triggering keyboard. Let’s take a closer look.

How does Playbeat 4 Work?

Playbeat 4 (VST/VST, AU, AAX, iOS and standalone) is an eight-channel sequencer with hundreds of internal sounds and pattern presets. You can also import your own samples as folders or individual files.

The workflow is built around advanced controls for randomizing either each channel or all channels at once. Parameters that can be randomized include Steps, Density, Pitch, Volume, and Pan. On the main tab, each parameter features a dice button to the right, allowing for instant randomization.

The big red button is not a nuclear button but is the master randomizer. When clicked, it creates a new pattern with new sounds. It also randomizes all five of the main parameters at once for your selected channel. There are four randomization algorithms to choose from, including SMART, which generates a pattern based on your saved preset collection.

The new slider below the main button determines the complexity of the pattern that Playbeat will generate next. If you have ‘ALL’ selected, the randomization will apply to all eight channels. This is chaotic, but the lock icon at the right of the channels allows you to disqualify channels from the reshuffling.

One significant update in Playbeat 4 is the ability to select whether you generate new patterns, new sounds, or both every time you press the red button (shown at the bottom left of the image above)

The sequencer allows for practical techniques such as setting separate timing, step count and swing values for each channel. There are also Sample Edit and Mixer windows with the traditional sampler parameters and fader layout you’d expect.

The ever-practical Export window deserves a mention. It’s easily one of the simplest drag-and-drop workflows for exporting your audio and MIDI for each channel or all at once.

AI-driven tools are putting more power in the hands of artists

Generate Patterns By Genre

Now let’s take a look at the new features. The below AI section allows you to select up to three genres out of 35 available. The patterns and sounds created when you hit the master randomizer will be generated depending on your selection. You can also toggle off the AI control at the top left of the main window.





As a quick note, even when this isn’t toggled Playbeat 4 is using some form of local AI algorithms to generate more usable patterns.

Let’s quickly test out the process. First we’ll insert Playbeat 4 on an empty MIDI channel and set the complexity slider to above 70%. Next, we’ll select the Garage genre in the AI section. Now, we’ll hit the randomizer.

After 1 or 2 tries, here’s a beat that sounds good. Note, that all sounds in our demos are from Playbeat’s sound collection, not our own samples.





That’s great, but it’s begging for some swing! We’ll select All to affect all eight channels at once and dial the swing up to 50%:



Now we’re talking! As we already have a pattern we like, let’s try randomizing just the sounds until we come up with a cool pattern. Here are two we quite enjoyed:



You can always go in and randomize individual sounds or patterns if there’s a more specific timbre you’re looking for. It’s also easy to manually replace the samples in each channel with your own samples or sounds from Playbeat’s library.

The Triggering Keyboard

We definitely want to demonstrate more examples with more genres, but first, let’s introduce the new triggering keyboard! This splits your MIDI keyboard into three sections. The lowest octave can be used to launch each individual sample.

The second octave assigns the pattern of each sample’s channel to the first nine notes – including one for launching the full beat, when held down. The HOLD control is extremely useful here and very practical for live performance a bit similar to launching clips with Ableton.

The third and fourth octaves form the Remixes section. When you click Generate in this section Playbeat creates 24 similar variations of your current beat and assigns each one to the 24 keys.

Let’s test this out by generating a brand new beat. We’ll select Electro and Breakbeats in the AI section, set the complexity slider to 55%, and hit the master randomizer. Here’s a pattern we settled on after two-three clicks:

Now we’ll hit Generate in the Remixes section on the triggering keyboard. We’ll hit record now and hit a different remix key after every two bars. This means every two bars we’ll be getting a slightly varied pattern:

Below is another example with a pattern generated with Techno and Lo-Fi selected in the AI section. We’re again switching to a different remixed version with the generated Remix keys every two bars:

Price And Competition

At €89, with an intro price of €69, Playbeat 4 for Mac and Windows remains affordable despite the obvious investment. Previous customers can upgrade for €29 and the iPad iOS version is free with In-App purchases. It is also part of Audiomodern’s Complete Suite bundle alongside Soundbox, Chordjam, Riffer, Gatelab, and Filterstep, currently priced at €269.

In terms of competition at similar price points, there’s HY-MPS3 by HY-Plugins ($50), ADSR Orbit ($30), and Toneworks Catalyst ($79).

For free options, Ableton’s new Sequencers Pack update in Live 12 is a must-try. If you use Splice, their Splice Beatmaker tool also has numerous AI and randomization features.

Competition aside, it’s no secret that we’re big fans of Audiomodern and the updated Playbeat. Their knack for blending intuitive GUIs with powerful, effective features makes them a standout contender in this field. While there’s always room for improvement, such as more control over swing types and additional subgenres, the broad-stroke genres currently offered are still highly effective for most producers. It would also be great to see on-board FX in future updates – this could elevate the overall proposition. Additionally, incorporating AI-driven macros could significantly speed up the creative process. Despite these suggestions, the product remains incredibly useful for producers looking for a quick, powerful, and intuitive solution for their workflow.

The Verdict Price: €69 Purchase: Audiomodern Playbeat Sound Build Versatility Value Ease of Use Overall The Final Word With Playbeat’s new features, you’re just 6-7 clicks away from an endless supply of creative, customizable patterns—what’s not to love?
