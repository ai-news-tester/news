          <p>The AI world is hitting our wallets with prices that might make even Wall Street veterans do a double take. While banks have long charged hefty fees for premium services, artificial intelligence (AI) companies are now joining the high-price club with some truly jaw-dropping figures. What happened to all that talk about AI making things cheaper and more efficient?

$20,000 Per Month for an AI Assistant? You Read That Right

OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is planning to launch AI “agents” with price tags that might make you spill your coffee. According to recent reports, it’s eyeing a tiered pricing plan that starts at $2,000 monthly for basic agents aimed at “high-income knowledge workers.” Need something a bit more sophisticated for software development? That’ll be $10,000 per month. And if you want the top-tier, PhD-level research agent, prepare to shell out an astonishing $20,000 every month.

To put that in perspective, OpenAI’s current premium offering, ChatGPT Pro, costs $200 monthly and is reportedly still losing money. The jump from $200 to $20,000 is a 100-fold increase. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has apparently acknowledged they need to “charge much more than $200 a month” for these advanced agents. The company is banking on these agent products to generate between 20% and 25% of its long-term revenue.

SoftBank seems convinced these prices make sense — the investment company has already committed to spend $3 billion on OpenAI’s agents this year alone. The justification? These AI assistants supposedly do work comparable to highly paid professionals.

The Wild West of AI Pricing

The pricing inconsistency across the AI landscape is enough to give you whiplash. Some companies are stuffing AI features into existing products and bumping prices, while others charge only when the AI completes a task.

For comparison, a coding agent from startup Cognition called Devin costs about $500 monthly — significantly less than OpenAI’s planned $10,000 offering for similar functionality. This kind of price variation leaves customers scratching their heads about what’s reasonable.

Whatever approach companies take, one thing is clear: AI doesn’t come cheap. The massive data centers powering these systems cost between $500,000 and over $1 billion annually, according to McKinsey & Company. Those specialized AI chips? They run between $10,000 and $30,000 each. A single server rack packed with these chips can easily cost over $500,000 before even turning on the power.

Is It Really Worth It?

The million-dollar question (sometimes literally): Are these AI services actually worth these premium prices? Companies claim these tools can replace work done by highly paid professionals. A Ph.D.-level research agent at $20,000 monthly costs about the same as hiring a human researcher with advanced credentials.

Defenders of these prices point out that AI assistants work 24/7 without breaks or benefits. They don’t quit unexpectedly or need training when you change projects. They can potentially process information faster than any human researcher.

However, skeptics wonder if these theoretical advantages really justify the sky-high costs. Can an AI agent perform complex tasks requiring deep understanding and original thinking? With their regulatory requirements, financial institutions need to be especially careful about relying too heavily on systems that sometimes generate incorrect information.

The Bottom Line

As artificial intelligence transforms from a cool experiment to an essential business tool, we’re witnessing a gold rush mentality in pricing. While there are legitimate costs behind developing and running these systems, the current prices seem to include a healthy dose of “what the market will bear” thinking.

Considering that, according to PYMNTS Intelligence data, the same market is starting to report positive returns on investments (ROI) on its GenAI investments, it might be willing to bear the higher costs.

Will these prices eventually come down as competition increases and technology improves? History suggests they might. But for now, if you want the cutting edge of AI, be prepared for some serious sticker shock. The smartest approach might be testing these premium-priced tools selectively while keeping a healthy skepticism about whether that shiny new AI assistant is really worth its weight in digital gold.

          <p>Shannon Cuykendall gives a presentation about her research on generative artificial intelligence with one hand, while holding her six-month-old son in the other.

Cuykendall is a postdoctoral researcher at Simon Fraser University's iViz Lab, a majority-female AI lab in a field dominated by men.

In Canada, women make up less than one-quarter of the people employed in STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) careers, according to the federal government. But 75 per cent of researchers at the iViz Lab in Surrey, B.C., are women.

"It's not looked down upon to bring your kids into the lab if you need to," Cuykendall said in an interview with CBC News.

One academic who researches gender, diversity and inclusion in STEM says labs across the country should take note of SFU's lab.

"When an environment is created where women can succeed, all kinds of women with all different life experiences and all different needs can succeed, that's really incredible," said Lisa Willis, an assistant professor of biological sciences at the University of Alberta.

"That shows other labs that it can be done. It gives us ideas for how to implement things in our own labs."

Beating the odds

Women still make up only one-third of the global scientific community, with the percentage stagnating over the past decade, according to a 2024 report by UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization). In some countries, less than 10 per cent of researchers are women.

They hold just 22 per cent of STEM jobs in G20 countries, and only one in 10 ascend to leadership positions.

While progress has been made, sexism continues to be a problem in STEM fields, which are often perceived as masculine domains, according to Willis. She said that leaves many women and girls feeling like they don't belong in STEM.

The SFU lab currently has eight researchers — six women and two men who are working on their master's degrees and PhDs. There are also four female undergraduate students that are doing research as part of their studies. Previous researchers have gone on to take up leadership roles at tech companies and in academia.

"It's cool to have so much collaboration with people who have an understanding of what it is to be someone who is marginalized in this field, and it's cool to see other women who are also interested in technology," said PhD candidate and iViz researcher Julia Read.

WATCH | How SFU's AI lab is defying the STEM gender gap: Women lead the way at SFU AI lab Duration 2:24 The gender gap in STEM — or science, technology, engineering and math — remains significant. But almost all researchers at Simon Fraser University’s artificial intelligence lab are women. CBC's Yasmine Ghania spent a day at the lab that's bucking the trend.

The researchers say the lab is their community, a place full of mentorship, friendship and the flexibility needed to balance other aspects of their lives.

"I've taken a number of years off to take care of my daughter and I've come back to school and [the lab] is very supportive of my personal needs," said PhD candidate Meehae Song.

Currently, Song is using AI-enhanced, wearable sensors to collect physiological data that can help people practise meditation and mindfulness. Her 16-year-old daughter comes to the lab with her and helps her with the research by wearing the sensors.

"I think that's why our research is so interesting, because it's very organic. We bring a lot of our personal experiences into the research," Song said.

Using AI to get a raise

Master's student Charlotte Hou, who previously obtained a master's in negotiation and conflict resolution from Columbia University, is developing an AI model to help women in the corporate world negotiate raises.

Users can talk back and forth with a male boss until the AI character agrees to give them a raise, allowing women to gain confidence in a realistic but low-risk setting, said Hou.

"I wanted to empower women … to fight for what they deserve," she said, adding that women could also use the AI model to practise for job interviews or other ways to advance their careers.

"A lot of us think AI is such a threat but that is completely wrong because AI is an assistant and that's why we're using it to help women," she said.

'I just like to work with smart people'

The SFU lab is led by Steve DiPaola, who's the director of the university's cognitive science program. He says he's recruited many female researchers who had shown a lot of potential in his lectures but were shy.

"They're nodding at the right time and just going up to them and saying, 'Hey, you would be good at this,'" DiPaola said.

But he says he knows that as a man, he has to walk a fine line.

"How do you do it in a way that's not overpowering? I'm always thinking about those issues, although in general, I just like to work with smart people," DiPaola said.

Willis, the University of Alberta assistant professor, wants to see more programs that get girls interested in STEM from a young age and for people in leadership positions to continue talking about the gender inequalities that still exist in the fields.

Lisa Willis, an assistant professor of biological sciences at the University of Alberta, says despite more women being in STEM now, there’s still work to do to make women feel more welcome in those spaces. (Emily A. Agard)

Willis says she tries to create a welcoming environment in her glyco-immunology lab. She has a code of conduct on her website that says, in part, "offensive behaviour or comments related to gender, gender identity and expression … are not welcome."

"So anyone who's searching for me can look at my website, see that I care about people as humans and if that is something that they're interested in, then they reach out to me. And the number of women who reach out to me is astronomical," she said.

Currently, her lab is 100 per cent women.

"That's not because I'm screening out men," she said. "It's because women want to work somewhere where they will be seen and valued and be able to be successful."</p>
