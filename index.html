This industry-first AI-driven assistant transforms watchlist screening by drastically improving how organizations handle sanctions, politically exposed persons (PEP), and adverse media matches. Socure’s solution delivers unmatched speed, accuracy, and efficiency by reducing false positives, accelerating case reviews, and improving analyst decision-making.



Traditional watchlist screening is often plagued by inefficiencies that strain compliance teams—high false positives, time-consuming manual reviews, and regulatory complexity. Financial institutions, fintechs, and global organizations face mounting pressure to comply with rapidly evolving restrictions from agencies like OFAC, with penalties for non-compliance exceeding $8 billion globally over the past two years.



A Smarter, More Efficient Approach to Watchlist Screening



Socure’s Global Watchlist Screening and Monitoring solution introduces a patent-pending, two-stage scoring system providing dual controls. The first stage assigns a Name Match Score, creating a candidate pool by assessing how closely a customer’s name aligns with watchlist entries. This is then enriched with additional personally identifiable information (PII) for a clearer risk assessment.



In the second stage, an Entity Correlation Score replicates an analyst’s decision-making process, evaluating the likelihood that the source list and the matched entity are the same. This critical step strengthens regulatory compliance by minimizing false positives and negatives, significantly reducing the need for manual reviews, and streamlines compliance.



For each match, the AI Copilot transforms operational workflows by creating consistency in process, reducing human subjectivity, and ensuring standardized documentation. By clearly articulating disqualification criteria in plain language, the AI Copilot removes the burden on analysts to manually craft decision narratives, instead delivering clear, structured explanations. Analysts remain in control to confirm or override results, with all actions logged for transparency and compliance.



Additional Features in the Solution Include:



Real-Time Analysis - Instantly processes potential matches in just two seconds.

Contextual Understanding -Powered by Natural Language Reasoning (NLR), the AI Copilot recognizes multiple aliases, contextual identifiers, and cultural variations, reducing false positives.

Streamlined Decision-Making - Accepts or rejects matches using AI-supported reasoning, with the ability to add investigative notes quickly.

Regulator-Ready Documentation - Generates audit-ready reports in an intuitive, streamlined interface.



The Results: Fewer False Positives, Less Analyst Fatigue, More Meaningful Productivity



By leveraging the new AI Copilot and advanced entity correlation, Socure’s solution delivers unmatched efficiency in watchlist screening, significantly reducing false positives, streamlining reviews, and cutting operational costs.



Key results include:



78% reduction in manual reviews - Reduce the number of flagged identities and false positives with improved accuracy, reducing unnecessary manual reviews and enabling analysts to focus on true risks and high-value, strategic tasks.

80% faster case reviews - Reduce average review time from 10-15 minutes to 2-3 minutes, allowing more cases to be processed daily and improving overall team productivity.

Up to 60% cost reduction - Reduce compliance operational costs by using AI narratives as templates for standardized investigations, creating consistent reviews that lower quality control costs by minimizing variability and errors.



AI Copilot in Action: Smarter Decisions with Fewer Errors



In a real-world test, AI Copilot flagged a case where “Paolo Garcea” and “Isabel Paola Garcia” showed 88% name similarity, which would traditionally trigger a manual review. However, the system identified critical mismatches in gender, ethnicity, and location, correctly classifying the alert as a likely false positive—saving time, reducing unnecessary escalations, and improving operational efficiency.



“The compliance landscape is evolving rapidly, and traditional watchlist screening simply hasn’t kept pace with the demands of modern risk management,” said Debra Geister, VP of Regulatory and Compliance Solutions at Socure. “With our AI Copilot, we are eliminating inefficiencies, slashing review times, and delivering the most precise match intelligence in the industry—all while reducing operational costs and analyst fatigue. This is a massive leap forward for compliance teams, giving them the speed, accuracy, and confidence they need to stay ahead of regulatory challenges.”



Customer Use Case: How Lili Transformed Compliance with Socure



Lili App Inc. (Lili) is a financial platform designed specifically for businesses, offering a combination of advanced business banking with built-in accounting and tax preparation software to help business owners better streamline and simplify their finances. As a fast-growing business banking platform, processing a high volume of transactions monthly, its team faced a critical scaling challenge. With regulatory requirements intensifying across the fintech industry and an estimated 70% increase in entities on global watchlists since 2020, they needed a better way to manage screening requirements during rapid growth.



Lili’s Challenge



Lili’s analysts spent hours reviewing an increasing number of potential matches, many of which turned out to be false positives. At the same time, their expanding small business customer base introduced new layers of screening complexity. With aggressive customer acquisition targets, maintaining a manual review approach was not sustainable.



Lili dramatically improved their watchlist screening process, achieving a 78% reduction in manual reviews, stronger audit trails, and the ability to reallocate analyst time to more strategic risk-mitigation efforts. Most importantly, Lili was able to maintain compliance with evolving regulatory requirements.



“Socure’s advanced two-score system has been transformative for our compliance team,” said Larry Sandor, Head of Compliance at Lili, “It has significantly reduced alert review time and false positives, and it has empowered our analysts to focus on complex investigations and higher-level risk assessments. We trust Socure and applaud their commitment to continuous innovation, and we appreciate their desire to partner with and learn from their customers —something we simply don’t see from others in this space.”</p>
