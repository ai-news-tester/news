          <p>Artificial intelligence is the technology that dominates the conversation, and 2025 will be the "year of adoption," where healthcare sees AI more broadly deployed across the industry, said Chris Althoff, executive vice president, marketing, at emtelligent, in Booth 124 at HIMSS25.

The company sells AI-driven systems designed to help healthcare organizations extract, structure and integrate unstructured clinical data.

Enhancing data access

"Apart from AI, healthcare organizations will continue to focus on addressing interoperability challenges and working to enhance data access and liquidity, as data increasingly becomes a key driver of innovation and revenue," he added.

As for AI, though, Althoff cautioned HIMSS25 attendees to be mindful of the hype.

"The healthcare IT space is crowded, especially with the growing buzz around AI," he stated. "Focus on connecting with specialists who have deep expertise in healthcare, rather than those who have simply adapted general-purpose models. Look for partners who not only bring this specialized knowledge but are also committed to growing alongside you on your AI journey – implementing pilot programs, achieving incremental successes and uncovering hidden value.

"These early wins will help build momentum for broader adoption, fueling internal innovation and driving meaningful transformation in both your operational workflows and clinical processes," he continued.

Healthcare AI versus generic AI

At HIMSS25, emtelligent is emphasizing that expert medical AI is key to transforming unstructured clinical data into actionable insights – generic AI systems simply are not enough for healthcare, Althoff contended.

"They lack the specialization needed to navigate medical terminology and the unique operational realities that exist across health systems, payers, pharma and the various other healthcare business models," he concluded.
