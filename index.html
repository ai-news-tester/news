          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) on Friday dropped a proposal to force Alphabet's Google to sell its investments in artificial intelligence companies, including OpenAI competitor Anthropic, to boost competition in online search.

The DOJ and a coalition of 38 state attorneys general still seek a court order requiring Google to sell its Chrome browser and take other measures aimed at addressing what a judge said was Google's illegal search monopoly, according to court papers filed in Washington.

Spokespeople for Google and Anthropic did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Google holds a minority stake worth billions of dollars in Anthropic. Losing the investment would hand a competitive advantage to OpenAI and its partner Microsoft, Anthropic wrote to the court in February.

The DOJ first made a draft recommendation in November. Prosecutors then continued to seek evidence from Google competitors and AI companies. The evidence showed a risk that banning Google from AI investments "could cause unintended consequences in the evolving AI space," prosecutors said in the final proposal on Friday. They asked that Google be required to give prior notice to the government about future investments in generative AI.

Google, which has said it will appeal, has made its own proposal that would loosen agreements with Apple and others to set Google as the default search engine on new devices. U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta has scheduled a trial on the proposals for April.

The blockbuster case brought during President Donald Trump's first term kicked off a crackdown against big tech companies that extended into former President Joe Biden's administration. Apple, Meta Platforms and Amazon.com also face allegations of maintaining illegal monopolies in their respective markets.

Since Trump's reelection, Google has sought to make the case that the DOJ's approach in the case would hobble the company's ability to compete in AI and "jeopardize America's global economic and technological leadership."

Many of the measures prosecutors proposed in November remain intact with a few tweaks.

A requirement that Google share search query data with competitors now says that Google can charge for the cost of access and that the competitors must not pose a national security risk.</p>

          <p>Some artificial intelligence improvements to Apple's voice assistant Siri will be delayed until 2026, the company said on Friday.

In a statement, Apple said it has "been working on a more personalized Siri, giving it more awareness of your personal context, as well as the ability to take action for you within and across your apps. It's going to take us longer than we thought to deliver on these features and we anticipate rolling them out in the coming year."

Apple did not give a reason for the delays. The iPhone maker had previously indicated the features would come in 2025.

Last year, Apple announced a range of AI-driven features called Apple Intelligence that included new capabilities such as rewriting emails and summarizing a cluttered inbox.

Some of the biggest improvements were aimed at giving its Siri assistant the ability to duck in and out of apps and complete tasks for a user by tapping into information stored on Apple devices.

Apple gave examples such as asking Siri to pull up a podcast recommended by a friend or pulling up flight tracking information from a relative, all based on data held on the device.

The company has been building a vast new cloud computing infrastructure that runs on its own chips in an effort to maintain its privacy stance while delivering AI features. Apple has said Siri fields 1.5 billion user requests per day.

Apple's rivals have also been rushing to add AI features to their voice assistants, with Alphabet's Google adding its Gemini model to its assistant last year.

Amazon last month rolled out an AI-driven overhaul of its Alexa assistant, saying that the new capabilities would be free for subscribers to its Prime program but cost $19.99 a month otherwise.</p>

          <p>I started writing in the 2010s when Python 2 was going to be deprecated and Python 3 was too early to support. Python might have died there and then but was picked up by the data science and machine learning community, so, it survived. Running Python in production comes with various gotchas though.

Python is resource-intensive#

Let’s consider a simple Docker image containing “Hello World”.

Docker 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 # Build: docker buildx build -t python-fastapi -f Dockerfile_python . # Size: docker image inspect python-fastapi --format='{{.Size}}' | numfmt --to=iec-i # Run: docker run -it --rm --cpus=1 --memory=100m -p 8000:8000 python-fastapi FROM python:3.12-slim AS base WORKDIR /app RUN pip3 install --no-cache-dir fastapi == 0.115.11 uvicorn == 0.34.0 SHELL [ "/bin/bash" , "-c" ] RUN echo -e "\ from fastapi import FastAPI

\ app = FastAPI()

\ @app.get('/')

\ async def root():

\ return {'message': 'Hello World'}\ " > /app/web_server.py ENTRYPOINT [ "uvicorn" , "web_server:app" , "--host=0.0.0.0" , "--port=8000" , "--workers=4" , "--limit-concurrency=32" ]

And a similar web server in Go.

Docker 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 # Build: docker buildx build -t go-webserver -f Dockerfile.gobuild . # Size: docker image inspect go-webserver --format='{{.Size}}' | numfmt --to=iec-i # Run: docker run -it --rm --cpus=0.06 --memory=6m -p 8001:8001 go-webserver FROM golang:1.24-alpine3.21 AS builder WORKDIR /app RUN apk add --no-cache bash ca-certificates tzdata RUN go mod init ashishb.net/example SHELL [ "/bin/bash" , "-c" ] RUN echo -e '\ package main

\

\ import (

\ "fmt"

\ "net/http"

\ )

\

\ func helloHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {

\ fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, World!")

\ }

\

\ func main() {

\ http.HandleFunc("/", helloHandler)

\ http.ListenAndServe(":8001", nil)

\ }' > /app/web_server.go RUN go build -o ./webserver FROM scratch AS runner COPY --from = builder /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt /etc/ssl/certs/ COPY --from = builder /usr/share/zoneinfo /usr/share/zoneinfo COPY --from = builder /app/webserver /app/webserver ENTRYPOINT [ "/app/webserver" ]

The Python docker image size is 164MiB while the Go docker image is 8MiB. Once you pull in any significant libraries, expect the Python image to balloon to 750MiB-1GiB range. The Go image, however, rarely crosses, 100MiB. Such large docker images are not great for auto-scaling during traffic spikes.

The other problem is that the Python image requires way more resources.

For example, the above Go-based web server when started with only 6MiB RAM (the lowest that Docker allows) performs as well as the Python build started under 16 times more RAM. Any RAM less than 100MiB and the Python-based server starts to hit OOM.

Bash 1 2 3 4 5 6 $ docker run -it --rm --cpus = 0.06 --memory = 6m -p 8001:8001 go-webserver $ docker run -it --rm --cpus = 1 --memory = 100m -p 8000:8000 python-fastapi # Similar performance when tested with # h2load --h1 -n1000 -c40 'http://localhost:8000' # h2load --h1 -n1000 -c40 'http://localhost:8001'

Further, the max concurrency of the FastAPI-based Python server is 40 while the one in Go is 150 (with only 6MiB of RAM). So, about a ~60X RAM difference. Coincidentally, a friend in YouTube infrastructure, who was involved in a fairly large migration from Python to C++, told me that cost reduction was about 60X.

This has huge implications for the financial costs and engineering hiring.

Imagine if your COGS are 20%.

So, you spend $20 for every $100 earned and half of it goes to hosting and serving costs. What if you can redirect 98% (~59/60) of that and spend that on hiring better engineers!

Python codebase is hard to maintain#

While it is easy to write baseline Python.

Far and few engineers can write good quality Python code.

Few understand the GIL limitations that Facebook is offering three engineers to fix.

Few know about common Python exceptions. A side note for those who know Java, all exceptions are unchecked in Python.

Few prevent new class fields assignments outside of the constructor.

More often than not, you will see dictionaries being passed from function to function as a loose form of object representation.

Python language and packages are hard to upgrade#

A minor change to setuptools and the whole Python ecosystem broke on a Sunday afternoon.

Or a patch version upgrade from Python 3.12.3 -> 3.12.4 broke langchain.

I have upgraded several production and hobby projects in Java, Go, and Python.

Nothing is as painful as it is in the Python world.

Even Python developer tooling no longer prefers Python#

The developer tooling for Go is written in Go.

The developer tooling for Rust is written in Rust.

The developer tooling for Java is written in Java.

However, look at the recent developments in Python tooling,</p>

          <p>Left isolated due to the draconian policies of the Taliban administration, women in Afghanistan have been forced to turn to artificial intelligence (AI) for friendship. Since seizing power in 2021 after the US hastily withdrew its troops, the Taliban has imposed a series of oppressive measures against women in the country, restricting their independence and ability to co-exist as a normal human being.

Lima, an 18-year-old from rural Afghanistan, told BBC that she is seeking help of AI and treating it as a friend to get through the days.

"Reading novel, or chatting with AI, usually, to empty every single word of me - to talk, ask questions, or simply treat as a friend," she said when quizzed about how she spends her mornings.

"The AI app makes a character of your favourite idol. All the famous people you know you can talk with them or say anything you want. You can ask them questions. You can give yourself a fake hope and make them your friend or family."

Apart from AI, Lima finds solace in music with her favourite artists being Billie Eilish, BTS, Tamino, Lana Gel Ray, Lady Gaga, Shawn Mendes and Charlie Puth.

"I spend my day with music. During nights, I think a lot - like a crazy overthinker, about the uncertain future I'll face."

Details of the crackdown on women's rights:

Taliban authorities have mandated that women cover their faces. They are also barred from travelling without a male guardian.

Women are no longer allowed in public and amusement parks.

Gyms and fitness centres are not allowed to entertain women.

Girls are allowed to go to school until the age of 12, or grade 6. Education after this has been disallowed.

Women banned from medical training.

Women's radio stations permanently shut.

National and foreign non-governmental groups barred from employing women.

While March 8 is celebrated globally as International Women's Day, for women in Afghanistan, it passes as an ordinary day, offering no respite from the tyrannical treatment they endure under the Taliban's regime.</p>
