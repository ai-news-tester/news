          <p>Ola Electric’s founder, Bhavish Aggarwal, has pledged an additional 5.88 crore shares of his stake to secure debt financing for his artificial intelligence startup, Krutrim. This follows a recent pledge of 4.83 crore shares (around 1.10% of Ola Electric) made three months earlier.

Aggarwal has signed a non-disposal undertaking for these newly pledged shares concerning debentures issued by Krutrim on February 21 and 24. These debentures were issued to multiple financial entities, including Avendus Structured Credit Fund II, Avendus Finance Private Limited, Incred Credit Opportunities Fund I and II, and India Credit Opportunities Fund II.

The committment made earlier had already pledged 4.83 crore shares of Ola Electric to Axis Trustee Services Limited, acting on behalf of Avendus Structured Credit Fund II and Avendus Finance Private Limited.

With this latest pledge, Aggarwal has now pledged a total of 2.43 per cent of Ola Electric’s shares (8.09%)of his personal stake in the company to raise capital for Krutrim.

The shares of Ola Electric closed at ₹56.40, down by 0.53 on BSE yesterday.

          <p>The U.S. State Department will use artificial intelligence to revoke visas of foreign students who it perceives as supporters of Palestinian Hamas militants, Axios reported on Thursday, citing senior State Department officials.

Fox News separately reported the State Department revoked the visa of a student who allegedly participated in what the department termed as "Hamas-supporting disruptions." The revocation marked the first such action, according to the report.

The State Department was working with the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security, according to Axios.

The State Department did not comment directly on the reports but Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on social media that the United States "has zero tolerance for foreign visitors who support terrorists." He added that "violators of U.S. law - including international students - face visa denial or revocation, and deportation."

The other two departments did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order in January to combat antisemitism and has pledged to deport non-citizen college students and others who took part in pro-Palestinian protests.

The AI-fueled "Catch and Revoke" effort will include AI-assisted reviews of tens of thousands of student visa holders' social media accounts, Axios reported.

Axios said officials were checking news reports of demonstrations against Israel's policies and Jewish students' lawsuits highlighting foreign nationals allegedly engaging in antisemitism.

The Fox News report did not mention any details about the person whose visa was revoked except that it was revoked on Wednesday, that the person was a university student and that the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement will proceed with removing that person from the country. It cited a State Department spokesperson.

Some pro-Palestinian groups are Jewish themselves, and many protesters have denounced antisemitism and Hamas.

Trump has said he will stop federal funding for educational institutions that allow what he called illegal protests.

"Agitators will be imprisoned/or permanently sent back to the country from which they came. American students will be permanently expelled or ... arrested," Trump said on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, several people were arrested at a sit-in arranged by pro-Palestinian students in the main lobby of Barnard College in New York. Protesters distributed pamphlets, including Hamas' Media Office material justifying the Oct 7. attack on Israel. Images of Hamas fighters, including slain leader Yahya Sinwar, were hung on the walls.
