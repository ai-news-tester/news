      <p class="card-text">In a time of "rapid change and uncertainty" the longtime IT and interoperability leader is also hearing lots of questions about e-prior authorization, identity and access management and getting ROI from compliance investments.</p>

          <p>InterSystems has been on the scene for a long time now, since 1978, and has seen technology trends come and go. Artificial intelligence is one that has staying power – and enormous transformative potential for healthcare.

That's why, at HIMSS25 this year, the company is particularly focused on "helping our clients build the best foundation possible to deploy generative AI," says Kathleen Aller, head of global healthcare market strategy at InterSystems.

"We plan to highlight the importance of having comprehensive, clean data and the tools to manage it well, such as interoperability, identity management, connections to the whole relevant health and care ecosystem, and the data management capabilities to build and deploy your own AI models," Aller explains.

"In times of rapid change and uncertainty, our role at InterSystems is to make sure our customers are already ready for whatever might come their way," she adds. "We ensure that the healthcare organizations and solution developers we serve have the capabilities in hand to be ready for whatever the future may hold."

But AI is hardly the only thing InterSystems is focused on, of course. The longtime database and information exchange leader is also focused on helping its wide array of healthcare clients meet the many other demands of succeeding in a fast-moving industry with ever-evolving demands.

For instance, "there is tremendous interest from health plans in understanding both how they can meet regulatory requirements for e-prior authorization and interoperability and how they can get more value from their investment in compliance," said Aller.

What else should visitors be looking for and asking about at the InterSystems booth (#2032)?

"We’ll be featuring presentations from our product leaders and customers on several products: InterSystems Health Gateway, InterSystems Payer Services, our international EHR, and InterSystems EMPI with Referential Matching," says Aller.

"We have customers like Todd Rogow, the CEO of Healthix, the largest public HIE in the US, speaking about the innovative work his team is doing to facilitate observational research and to apply GenAI to longitudinal health records. We also have our Innovators Showcase, highlighting several start-ups leveraging InterSystems technology to build next generation solutions."

InterSystems will kick off the week with a Monday night reception at the Las Vegas Sphere.

And on Wednesday, the company hosts its annual Lunch and Learn program for health plan leaders.

"This year, the topic is the challenge of scaling electronic prior authorization to a national level. We’ll have speakers from eHealth Exchange, Jay Nakashima, and from the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, Doug Dietzman," say Aller. "Both organizations are putting in place hub and spoke models and will share their perspective on both the challenges and what they have achieved. And InterSystems Julie Smith will be providing an update on InterSystems Payer Services for regulatory compliance.:

InterSystems leaders and clients are also participating in several key sessions, says Aller.

On Tuesday, at 10:15 a.m., in San Polo 3501, it's hosting a multinational panel on "freeing the EHR from the constraints of the past," she explains, noting that it's a follow-up to a session last year, where Dr. Yaa Kumah-Crystal of Vanderbilt reviewed some of the ways GenAI could simplify existing processes, "and then said, 'but why do we even need to do that?' Dr. Kumah-Crystal will moderate the session, with panelists from Red Cell Partners US, EMC, Indonesia, Mediclinic Middle East in the UAE and UC Christus in Chile.

On Wednesday, at 10 a.m., also in San Polo 3501, "we have a panel on the role of interoperability in fueling digital health innovation with data," says Aller. That one is more focused on technology developers and will include panelists from Rock Health Advisory, Mass General Brigham Innovation and iRhythm.

Also on Wednesday, at 1:30 p.m. in Delfino 4103, InterSystems will be hosting an international workshop and lunch titled, "From Innovation to Integration – Practical Considerations for Clinical AI," she says. It will be led by the company's head of EHR Strategy and Operations, Dimitri Fane, and will include leaders from NHS Scotland, Gemelli Hospital in Italy and EMC Health in Indonesia.

"Given the incredibly complex regulatory and compliance landscape globally, we think this will be an important topic as GenAI becomes more widely adopted outside the U.S.," says Aller.

InterSystems will be in Booth 2032 at HIMSS25.</p>

          <p>I constructed a residual neural network. The model input image and output image. When the model is used, it is an autoregressive method. However, my model generalization ability is very poor. Is there any way to improve the model generalization ability ? Or how to change the structure of the neural network ? I only show a small part of the data here, and I have 50000 iterations. The generalization ability of the results is still very poor, and the model has the problem of over-fitting.</p>
