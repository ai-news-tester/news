          <p>"An Oprah Winfrey Special: The Menopause Revolution" airs on March 31 on ABC and the next day on Disney+ and Hulu.

After addressing topics like weight loss and artificial intelligence with in-depth conversations over the past year, Oprah Winfrey is now tackling the inevitable phase of life every woman will face: menopause.

In "An Oprah Winfrey Special: The Menopause Revolution," Winfrey will interview a panel of medical experts and leading voices to discuss the traditionally taboo topic of menopause before a live studio audience.

Special guests include actresses Halle Berry and Naomi Watts, journalist and women's health advocate Maria Shriver, and more.

A group of women from all walks of life who have experienced a wide array of midlife transitions will also be featured in the primetime event.

"When I was around 48 years old, I thought I was dying and went from doctor to doctor trying to understand why my heart was racing, and did not receive any answers until I picked up a book and read how heart palpitations can be a symptom indicating a change is coming to your body," said Winfrey.

She went on to say, "This show starts the revolution of answers for millions of women throughout this country. We discuss what you need to know to best advocate for yourself when it comes to mental health, sleep, weight, sex and your brain so we can ultimately see how freeing menopause can be in your life, with the best yet to come."

"An Oprah Winfrey Special: The Menopause Revolution" airs on March 31 on ABC and the next day on Disney+ and Hulu.

Disney is the parent company of Disney+, Hulu and this station.</p>

Christie’s first auction of art made by artificial intelligence (AI) ended Wednesday with mixed results, providing scant clues as to the future of the new and controversial medium.

Fourteen of the 34 lots put on the block during the 14-day online auction either received no qualifying bids or were sold for less than the minimum Christie’s had estimated.

One did go for more than expected — an animation by well-known digital artist Refik Anadol titled “Machine Hallucinations – ISS Dreams – A” which fetched the highest price at $277,200.

But an “Emerging Faces” creation by American artist Pindar Van Arman, touted as another highlight of the auction, saw no qualifying bids.

A work by the late American artist Charles Csuri, considered a pioneer of “computer art,” went for $50,400, slightly below the bottom of a price range announced by the auction house.

Auction sales tallied $728,784 in total, according to Christie’s.

For Nicole Sales Giles, Christie’s director of digital art, the auction’s results confirm that collectors recognize the influence and importance of the artists whose creations were featured.

“There could have been a better selection of works that are more representative of new media and AI,” said Steven Sacks, founder of New York gallery bitforms, which has been exhibiting digital art since 2001.

“The bigger conversation is — should they be at auction yet?”

Sacks felt more time was still needed to educate people about the medium and for artists to gain credibility and exposure.

A separate group of artists had launched a petition urging Christie’s to cancel the sale.

The 6,490 or so signatories argued that some pieces had been created with the help of AI models “known to have made unauthorized use of works protected by intellectual property law.”

For them, auctioning AI-created art lets money be made from “massive theft of works by human artists.”

In 2023, several artists sued generative AI start-ups, including popular platforms Midjourney and Stability AI, contending the software models were “trained” with human-made works to which they had no rights.

Christie’s and rival Sotheby’s have featured AI-created works at auctions in the past, but this was Christie’s first event devoted to works conceived with the new technology.

In 2018, an algorithm-generated painting by French collective Obvious fetched $432,500, including fees and commissions, stunning the art world.

And in 2022, an animated work by Refik Anadol was acquired, also at Christie’s, for $1.38 million.</p>
