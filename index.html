Philippine MSMEs embrace AI: A game changer for efficiency and growth as the government pushes for integration of the technology in business operations

MANILA, Philippines – The artificial intelligence (AI) wave is in the Philippines and it is expected to increase its influence over the operations of businesses and governments worldwide.

In the Philippines, micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) have started investing in AI just as the government has jumpstarted integrating it into its services.

Truelogic, a 15-year-old digital marketing firm based in the Philippines, in its report based on its managing partner, listed prosthetics company Instalim, logistics and delivery firm Mober, and credit scoring company Finscore among the companies that have started adopting the technology into its operations.

Truelogic CEO Itamar Gero, citing his company’s own experience integrating AI, said those choosing to adopt the technology early took into account how it can help in removing inefficiencies and reducing “mindless” work.

“MSMEs don’t have this big, big amount of data, they don’t have the big amounts of budgets to do it, but where they can start [with AI] is in the grassroots, in the employees,” Gero said in an interview with Rappler.

Truelogic handles the digital marketing of several Philippine companies. For the marketing firm, AI helps cut downtime on operations, expedite research, and streamline feedback mechanisms.

Gero said any local MSME handling customer data in marketing and research could also benefit from the technology as it afforded its employees more time to do high-level work.

“[AI] gets people to do more brain work versus, you know, waiting [for] work. What it brings about is the workforce needing to be a lot more exhaustive of their kind of high-end work versus mindless work like researching, looking at facts, copy-pasting,” he said.

Gero said Truelogic planned to continue its investments in the technology.

“Part of our processes, we do have AI; we are working on investing in our own AI tools [for] market insight, market research, because we realized there is not enough for the Filipino market to identify gaps in the market,” he said in an interview with Rappler.

“AI has streamlined anything around research, content strategies, social media strategies,” he added.

Philippine outlook on AI

On April 30, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr directed the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) to make local MSMEs AI-ready, setting the tone for how the country will adopt AI technology four years after it became broadly accessible to the public through OpenAI’s ChatGPT-3 and image generating Dall-E 2.

The DTI expects that with AI, as much as $92 billion could be contributed to the country’s economy within 7 years.

The DTI also launched a new “Center for AI Research” in July.

The growing AI interest in the Philippines reflects emerging trends abroad.

While still in the early implementation phase of their AI-related initiatives, six Southeast Asian nations have already joined the Philippines in releasing their own national AI framework. These countries include Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.

Prior to the launch of text and image-generating platforms, consultation firm Kearney already projected that AI would generate about $1 trillion for the Southeast Asian economy by 2030.

Japan-based Ana Arriola-Kanada, co-director of IDEO Tokyo and a specialist on AI and machine learning, said optimism on the impact of AI in businesses reflects global interests, given its ability to augment the operational capacities of MSMEs.

“I think the excitement is going to be in the small- and medium-sized businesses, I think it’s going to be fun to see how these little, tiny companies are going to innovate using this new technology,” she told Rappler.

“Smaller companies are probably using G Suite and Gemini; if you think about the medium-sized businesses, then they are the ones that are more likely to make the investment into more of a smaller enterprise-type solution, like the Microsoft Dynamics 365,” she said.

“So there’s a major uptick right now, you can think of it like the current state of the industry as being a movie that we all want to watch that we all waited to be released, and now the movie is being released, and we’re starting to see what the adventure is all about, what the possibilities are,” she said.

Local SMEs must adopt, adapt

According to Microsoft and LinkedIn’s “2024 Work Trend Index on AI Use at Work in the Philippines”: “86% of Filipino knowledge workers use AI at work, higher than the global average of 75% and regional average of 83%.”

Given the growing interest among both businesses and employees, Arriola-Kanada is optimistic that MSMEs will begin integrating AI to maximize its benefits, especially given the risk of job displacements in some industries if they are unable to adapt.

“I don’t think it’s taking over their job functions, I think it’s [going to] help them. They’re [going to] be able to spend more time on their product, making their product, being with their customers, building new business, doing more sales, and not having to worry about back office related stuff, so I think it’s a positive thing,” she said.

However, Arriola-Kanada pointed out that job displacements may still be possible in engineering and programming if companies in the two industries fail to adapt to the changing landscape.

Truelogic’s Gero, meanwhile, said industries have always been able to adopt emerging technologies throughout history.

“I do think [we have] this kind of self-healing property of our culture; it will not leave people behind, even if it takes a year or two, even if it [takes] changing the curriculum. This is where we have to act, the curriculum, the grassroots,” he said.

Gero pointed out that for instance, the business process outsourcing (BPO) industry should start looking at how it can use and maximize the new technology in business. As AI voice agents continue to improve, displacement within the industry remains possible. (READ: Will IT-BPM workers and students survive without AI skills?)

“So the BPO needs to look at what assets that the BPO environment here has, and try to leverage that. Try to not fight with AI, but support AI, support AI companies, support AI models, just bring AI closer to home,” the Truelogic founder said.

He noted how Truelogic adopted the technology, giving the company room for growth due to more streamlined operations and added capacity for handling data with the aid of AI.

Gero added that it is essential for MSMEs to start experimenting with AI to remain competitive.

Meanwhile, Arriola-Kanada still puts emphasis that company growth is driven by management and employees themselves. Success is not reliant on AI.

Both Gero and Arriola-Kanada mentioned limiting the influence of AI in generative image programs, to check fraud and abuses.

“If they [SMEs] stay upskilled and they continue to have that radically youthful growth mindset where they’re constantly curious about how things are changing and how to use the changes and learn how to work with the changes, they’ll be fine, they’ll be fine 20 years from now,” she said.

“It’s the people who become complacent and just use ChatGPT as it is now, asking basic questions, and they don’t do the hard work of learning where agents are going, those are the ones [who] will be displaced.” – with a report from Fernando Pierre Marcel B. dela Cruz/Rappler.com

As AR technology becomes more advanced, its potential to enhance digital marketing campaigns will continue to grow.

Blockchain Technology and Its Role in Transparent Digital Advertising

Blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize digital advertising by increasing transparency and trust in online transactions. With its decentralized nature, blockchain ensures that all transactions are recorded and verified, making it nearly impossible to alter or manipulate the data.

One of the key challenges in digital advertising is ad fraud, where advertisers are often charged for clicks or views that never happen. Blockchain addresses this issue by ensuring that all transactions are transparent, providing a clear record of how, when, and where ads were displayed. Google My Business integration with blockchain platforms is already helping local businesses maintain a more secure and transparent digital footprint.

The transparency provided by blockchain also allows for more accurate attribution in digital advertising, ensuring that marketers only pay for valid, effective impressions. Over time, blockchain could significantly reduce ad fraud and improve the overall efficiency of digital marketing campaigns.

Voice Search Optimization and the Rise of Voice Commerce

Voice search has rapidly gained traction as consumers increasingly use voice assistants for everything from asking for directions to making purchases. In fact, Voice Search Optimization is now a critical component of any comprehensive SEO strategy, especially as voice-first searches become more prevalent. Marketers who optimize their content for voice search will have a significant advantage in connecting with consumers through this convenient and hands-free medium.

As voice assistants improve their AI capabilities, the process of making voice-enabled purchases will become even more seamless.

To stay competitive, businesses should focus on incorporating SEO Optimization Tips and best practices for voice search. This includes optimizing content for natural language, using structured data, and ensuring that their websites are mobile-friendly and fast-loading.

The Power of Big Data and Predictive Analytics in Shaping Marketing Strategies

Big data and predictive analytics are game-changers for digital marketers, offering deeper insights into consumer behavior and preferences. By analyzing vast amounts of data, marketers can identify trends and patterns that help them anticipate future customer needs. SEO Ranking Factors, for instance, are increasingly being informed by data-driven insights that shape how content is optimized to rank higher in search engines.

Predictive analytics can be used to forecast customer behavior, helping marketers fine-tune their strategies and create personalized campaigns that deliver higher ROI. Brands like Amazon and Google have successfully employed predictive analytics to deliver relevant advertisements and product recommendations, greatly enhancing customer satisfaction and engagement.

However, the use of big data comes with its own set of challenges. Ensuring data privacy and security while effectively leveraging customer information for marketing requires careful handling. Marketers must also be aware of the ethical implications of using consumer data, balancing personalization with privacy.

Wrapping Up

The digital marketing landscape is undergoing a major transformation as emerging technologies like AI, machine learning, AR, blockchain, and big data shape the way businesses connect with their audiences. Machine learning, in particular, has proven to be a valuable tool for delivering personalized experiences, predicting customer behavior, and optimizing campaigns. As marketers look toward the future, understanding and embracing these technological advancements will be key to staying ahead of the competition.

By integrating AI-driven insights, AR-powered experiences, blockchain transparency, voice search optimization, and big data analytics, businesses can enhance their digital marketing strategies and build stronger, more personalized connections with their customers. The future of digital marketing is here, and those who adopt and adapt to these technologies will be the leaders in tomorrow's marketplace.
