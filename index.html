          <p>KUALA LUMPUR: Mastering artificial intelligence (AI) will be a key factor in increasing the productivity of the local labour force, which is a prerequisite to raising local wages, says Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim.

Anwar said productivity of the labour force could be enhanced by upskilling programmes, the introduction of new subjects such as AI, new technology and among others.

“Ai is a challenging approach and even though we have a clear policy, its mastery is limited.

“So, instructions have been given to all research centres, including schools and universities, to give emphasis (on AI).

“I am of the opinion that the mastery of AI will determine whether or not Malaysia has the ability to raise its productivity,” said Anwar during Prime Minister’s Question Time in Parliament on Tuesday (March 4).

According to Anwar, that is why it is compulsory for some new foreign companies to set up centers of excellence in Malaysia as a condition to operate in the country.

“This is a condition for Nvidia, Microsoft, Google and Infineon,” added Anwar.

Anwar was responding to a supplementary question raised by Syed Saddiq Syed Abdul Rahman (Muda-Muar), who asked if there were plans by the government to raise wages and productivity of the labour force.

According to Syed Saddiq, Malaysia allocated about 0.8% of its GDP to research and development (R&D), which is lagging behind Singapore (2.2%).

Earlier, Anwar said that companies which made significant profits should ensure that their workers are paid fairly.

“Don’t record huge profits but pay your workers inadequately. There is a gap where productivity increases are not matched with wage increases, and inflation will affect them.

“We are taking steps (to address this),” said Anwar.

Meanwhile, Anwar also said the Malaysian economy had recorded growth of 5.1% last year, which is considered as among the highest in the region.

“Do these positive figures benefit the people? The answer is yes.

“It created 120,000 new jobs and the unemployment rate was at 3.1% as of Dec last year,” said Anwar.

The Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) had said last year that Malaysia’s economy growth in the fourth quarter of 2024 was mainly driven by continued expansion in the services, manufacturing and construction sectors.</p>

          <p>BARCELONA: OPPO announced its enhanced artificial intelligence (AI) strategy, positioning itself as a leader in AI experiences by delivering comprehensive, secure and continuously evolving AI solutions at OPPO AI Tech Summit during MWC2025.

“When it comes to AI, the user experience is ultimately all that matters,” said OPPO overseas marketing, sales and services president Billy Zhang.

“Smartphones are not just a vehicle for AI – they are the engines that power the best possible AI experiences.

As a global leader in smartphones, OPPO is driving in-house innovation and open collaboration with industry partners to bring our users these unparalleled AI experiences.”

As applications of AI continue to evolve, OPPO is advancing its AI experience from functional-level to system-level AI. This in turn is placing new demands on the extent of AI integration and security required on devices.

OPPO is further integrating Google AI experiences across its smartphones and Google Gemini can soon take action across native OPPO apps, such as Notes, Calendar, and Clock. These new capabilities will work alongside existing support for Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.5 Flash on OPPO AI Phones to unlock unprecedented levels of performance and responsiveness.

The two companies are working closely to bring the latest Gemini 2.0 to OPPO Phones soon.

To protect user security and privacy when accessing these deeply embedded AI features, OPPO is also implementing Private Computing Cloud (PCC) built with confidential computing from Google Cloud. Starting from AI Recording Summary, AI features including AI Search, AI Studio, AI Call Summary will be integrated with OPPO Private Computing Cloud this year.

“We are excited to collaborate with OPPO to shape the future of mobile AI by bringing together Google technologies with OPPO’s exceptional hardware and software,” said Google Cloud global solution and consumer AI managing director Matt Waldbusser.

“Through our extensive partnership spanning apps, AI models and cloud solutions, we are unlocking immense potential to redefine the mobile AI experience.”

Under its latest AI development strategy, OPPO is focusing on the three core areas of AI Productivity, AI Creativity, and AI Imaging to deliver meaningful features that will make AI an essential part of users’ everyday lives.

Underlying these three pillars is a comprehensive AI R and D strategy that covers the entire AI ecosystem – from chips and devices to the cloud.

OPPO is working closely with MediaTek to optimise chips for high-efficiency, real-time AI processing that enables powerful performance without compromising energy efficiency.

MediaTek wireless business group deputy general manager Will Chen said, “The partnership between MediaTek and OPPO is set to unlock new opportunities in AI. From AI-enhanced photography to next-generation gaming experiences, from intelligent security solutions to seamless device connectivity, the possibilities are limitless.”

On the device side, AI technologies like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), Parallel Decoding

Solution, and MoE (Mixture of Experts) are significantly boosting the performance of AI capabilities on OPPO devices. On the cloud, OPPO has built a comprehensive data security protection system that works across devices and the cloud.

Reaching more users with more features faster than ever

As AI technology and applications continue to develop, OPPO is evolving its own approach to redefine how AI enhances everyday experiences.

After surpassing its goal of reaching 50 million users last year, OPPO now aims to double that, expecting nearly 100 million users by the end of this year.

To meet users’ growing demand, OPPO will deliver an average of one new AI update per month. New AI innovations like AI Search and integration of OPPO applications with Google Gemini are coming to the OPPO Find N5 soon.

AI Call Translator, which interprets calls in multiple languages in real-time and AI VoiceScribe, offering multi-use voice summarization across voice calls, online learning, and meetings, are coming to OPPO devices via a future update.</p>

          <p>SINGAPORE: With the rapid proliferation of websites used for scams and other malicious cyber activities, the government is considering how to harness technology to autonomously disrupt these more rapidly, said Second Minister for Home Affairs Josephine Teo on Tuesday (Mar 4).

“We will continue to review our laws, to ensure their ability to deal with traditional crimes committed in cyberspace, and strengthen our regulatory frameworks, to better leverage technology to combat cybercrimes,” she added, while laying out the ministry’s spending plans for the year.

Mrs Teo, who is also Minister for Digital Development and Information, said in parliament that the threat landscape was increasingly complex.

“Criminals are exploiting technology, in particular, artificial intelligence (AI), to carry out more sophisticated crimes and to hit more victims,” she said.

A Scam Analytics and Tactical Intervention System (SATIS), jointly developed by GovTech and the Home Team’s science and technology agency HTX, is an existing example of how scam sites are hunted down and disrupted using AI and machine learning.

It goes beyond impersonated government websites to include bank phishing sites, sites hosting malware and those used in impersonation scams.

In a separate speech later on Tuesday, Minister of State for Home Affairs and Social and Family Development Sun Xueling revealed that SATIS would be expanded to disrupt other scam enablers such as payment channels and mobile numbers.

Mrs Teo said the Home Team has been leveraging technology in its work, particularly in using AI to combat AI-driven crime.

Its AI Movement was launched last year by HTX, to develop new AI capabilities across its various agencies.

HTX will hire and train 300 people for an AI workforce by the end of this year, she said. Some of its AI solutions have already been rolled out.

For instance, the Singapore Civil Defence Force's targeted on-site inspection tool uses AI to assess the likelihood of fire safety violations in commercial and industrial premises, using data such as past inspection reports.

The tool will be progressively rolled out to all frontline units for field testing in coming months, Mrs Teo said.

The Home Team is also leveraging smart and autonomous solutions to detect threats earlier, said Mrs Teo.

The Singapore Prison Service (SPS), for instance, is trialling the use of smart sensors in its medical wards and cells, to monitor inmates’ vital signs remotely.

As the SPS faces a growing pool of older inmates, the new system lets officers respond more quickly to incidents such as falls and abnormal heart rates among the inmates.</p>

MHA allows hiring of auxiliary cops from China, India; prisons trial sensors to track inmate health

SINGAPORE – In a bid to tackle falling birth rates, an ageing population and a manpower shortage, the Home Team is using technology and artificial intelligence (AI) to transform itself.

It will also hire more foreigners to fill certain roles that Singaporeans might not be keen on, said Second Minister for Home Affairs Josephine Teo.

Speaking during the debate on the Ministry of Home Affairs budget on March 4, she added: “In every aspect, the Home Team faces new and growing demands. The threat landscape is increasingly complex.

“The manpower constraints are also more binding. Birth rates are declining and the competition for talent is very tough.”

In her speech, Mrs Teo revealed some of the new tech and AI solutions for the Home Team.

A targeted on-site inspection tool powered by AI will be used by the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) to assess the likelihood of fire safety violations in commercial and industrial premises.

The tool uses data from various sources, including past inspection reports. This allows the SCDF to carry out inspections on a more targeted basis, said Mrs Teo.

The tool is expected to be progressively rolled out to front-line units for field testing in the coming months.

At the prisons, a life signs monitoring system is being trialled to track inmates’ vital signs remotely, enabling prison officers to respond more quickly to incidents such as falls and abnormal heart rates.

Mrs Teo said that this is especially important with more older inmates around.

She said the Home Team has also been taking steps to use AI against AI-enabled crime, as criminals use it to carry out more sophisticated attacks. One example is the growing use of generative AI by criminals to create deepfakes.

Mrs Teo added that scammers were also exploiting technology to produce fake content at speed and scale, and to target victims. They can also use it to manufacture evidence to mislead or frustrate investigators.

To counter this, the Home Team Science and Technology Agency (HTX) developed AlchemiX, a generative AI-powered algorithm that can identify whether audio or video recordings are genuine.

HTX launched the Home Team AI Movement in June 2024 to accelerate the development and delivery of AI capabilities. The Home Team has also put in place an AI governance framework, Mrs Teo said, with a set of principles to guide the implementation of AI projects and ensure compliance with the law.

She added that in the area of manpower, SCDF’s Emergency Medical Services (EMS) has been significantly impacted by the increase in overall demand by almost 30 per cent over the last five years.

She said that despite more competitive salaries, local recruitment was insufficient to meet all the needs.

“This is because EMS roles require advanced medical skills that are in short supply locally. Also, EMS work, although very fulfilling, is very challenging, and may not appeal to all.”

There has also been an increasing demand for security services, with the auxiliary police forces facing challenges in sustaining an adequate pool of auxiliary police officers (APOs).

In January 2024, Minister for Home Affairs K. Shanmugam said in a written parliamentary reply that this was due to a shrinking local workforce and other job options that Singaporeans have.

APOs were previously made up of just Singaporeans, Malaysians and Taiwanese, and he noted then that the ministry was considering expanding the list of jurisdictions APOs could be hired from.

The manpower demands are expected to grow even more with Singapore’s ageing population and with the total fertility rate remaining low at 0.97 in 2024 – the same as in 2023.

To deal with this, Mrs Teo said SCDF will be hiring foreigners as paramedics and emergency medical technicians from March.

APOs have been recruited from Sri Lanka, Myanmar, the Philippines, India and China, with these new officers making up about 3 per cent of the total APO workforce as at December 2024, she added.

Mrs Teo said: “Overall, the Home Team has achieved good outcomes for our people.

“These are reflected in how Singaporeans view the Home Team positively and hold our officers in high regard.”
