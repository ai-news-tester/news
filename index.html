          <p>Google has informed Australian authorities it received more than 250 complaints globally over nearly a year that its artificial intelligence software was used to make deepfake terrorism material.

The tech giant also said it had received dozens of user reports warning that its AI program, Gemini, was being used to create child abuse material, according to the Australian eSafety Commission.

Under Australian law, tech firms must supply the eSafety Commission periodically with information about harm minimisation efforts or risk fines.

The reporting period covered April 2023 to February 2024.

Since OpenAI's ChatGPT exploded into the public consciousness in late 2022, regulators around the world have called for better guardrails so AI can't be used to enable terrorism, fraud, deepfake pornography and other abuse.

The Australian eSafety Commission called Google's disclosure "world-first insight" into how users may be exploiting the technology to produce harmful and illegal content.

"This underscores how critical it is for companies developing AI products to build in and test the efficacy of safeguards to prevent this type of material from being generated," eSafety commissioner Julie Inman Grant said in a statement.

In its report, Google said it received 258 user reports about suspected AI-generated deepfake terrorist or violent extremist content made using Gemini, and another 86 user reports alleging AI-generated child exploitation or abuse material.

It did not say how many of the complaints it verified, according to the regulator.

Google used hatch-matching - a system of automatically matching newly-uploaded images with already-known images - to identify and remove child abuse material made with Gemini.

But it did not use the same system to weed out terrorist or violent extremist material generated with Gemini, the regulator added.

The regulator has fined Telegram and Twitter, later renamed X, for what it called shortcomings in their reports.

X has lost one appeal about its fine of $610,500 but plans to appeal again. Telegram also plans to challenge its fine.</p>

          <p>Christie’s first-ever auction dedicated to artificial intelligence-generated art, Augmented Intelligence, concluded on Wednesday, March 5, exceeding estimates and, according to the auction house, drawing a fresh wave of collectors.

The sale amassed $728,784, the auction house said in a press release, outpacing its $600,000 projection.

Notably nearly half of bidders, 48 percent, identified themselves as Millennials or Gen Z, while 37 percent were first-time buyers at Christie’s. The highest-grossing lot, Machine Hallucinations – ISS Dreams – A by Refik Anadol, fetched $277,200—well above its $200,000 estimate.

Holly Herndon & Mat Dryhurst’s diptych Embedding Study 1 & 2 (from the xhairymutantx series) was another high point, bringing in $94,500 on an estimate of between $70,000 and $90,000. The sale, which made up of 34 lots, had an 82 percent sell through rate.

The auction proceeded despite fierce opposition from thousands of artists, who have argued AI models of exploiting human creativity without consent. An open letter, signed by nearly 4,000 individuals, urged Christie’s to cancel the event, alleging that AI-generated artworks rely on datasets trained using copyrighted material without compensation.

The letter ended with a plea: “Your support of these models, and the people who use them, rewards and further incentivizes AI companies’ mass theft of human artists’ work. We ask that, if you have any respect for human artists, you cancel the auction.”

In response, the auction house defended the legitimacy of the featured artists, framing AI as a tool for creative expansion rather than replacement. “The artists represented in this sale have strong, existing multidisciplinary art practices, some recognized in leading museum collections,” the auction house told ARTnews at the time. “The works in this auction are using artificial intelligence to enhance their bodies of work.”

In the press release, Nicole Sales Giles, vice president and director of digital art sales, said “with this project, our goal was to spotlight the brilliant creative voices pushing the boundaries of technology and art. We also hoped collectors and the wider community would recognize their influence and significance in today’s artistic landscape. The results of this sale confirmed that they did.”

While some digital artists, including Beeple, championed the sale, others decried it as emblematic of the ongoing struggle between human artistry and machine-driven innovation. The results, however, suggest that AI art—controversial as it may be—is carving a firm place in the market.</p>

          <p>Google said Wednesday (March 5) that it launched two updates for its artificial intelligence features: expanded AI Overviews and a limited, experimental offering called AI Mode.

“With our new AI features, people are using Google Search more than ever as they get help with new and more complex questions,” Robby Stein, vice president of product for Google Search, wrote in a Wednesday blog post. “AI Overviews are one of our most popular Search features — now used by more than a billion people — and we’re continuing to advance and improve the experience to make them even better.”

The newly launched Gemini 2.0 for AI Overviews is now available in the United States to help with harder questions like coding, advanced math and multimodal queries, according to the post.

This expanded AI Overviews provides faster and higher quality responses, shows AI Overviews more often for harder questions, is available to teens and no longer requires users to sign in to get access, the post said.

The new, experimental Search mode, AI Mode, which uses a custom version of Gemini 2.0, can help with nuanced questions, answer follow-up questions and provide relevant web links, according to the post.

AI Mode can access web content, shopping data and other real-time information; issue multiple related searches concurrently; and bring the results together in its response, per the post.

This enables AI Mode to answer queries like, per the post, “What’s the difference in sleep tracking features between a smart ring, smartwatch and tracking mat?”

AI Mode will be made available, beginning Wednesday, to Google One AI Premium subscribers who receive an invitation, per the post.

“We’ve been getting feedback internally and from trusted testers, and they’ve found AI Mode incredibly helpful — they particularly appreciate the speed, quality and freshness of responses,” Stein wrote in the post.

AI Overviews was launched in the U.S. in May to provide an AI-generated summary of information from several sources along with search results.

Google reported in August that this feature was leading users to visit a greater diversity of websites for help with complex questions and was providing higher-quality clicks for websites.

          <p>By MICHAEL LIEDTKE

Google is updating its ubiquitous search engine with the next generation of its artificial intelligence technology as part of an effort to provide instant expertise amid intensifying competition from smaller competitors.

The company announced Wednesday that it will feed its Gemini 2.0 AI model into its search engine so it can field more complex questions involving subjects such as computer coding and math.

As has been the case since last May, the AI-generated overviews will be placed above the traditional web links that have become the lifeblood of online publishers dependent on traffic referrals from Google’s dominant search engine.

Google is broadening the audience for AI overviews in the U.S. by making them available to teenage searchers without requiring them to go through a special sign-in process to see them.

The stage is also being set for what could turn out to be one of the most dramatic changes to the search engine’s interface since Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin started the company in a Silicon Valley garage during the late 1990s.

Google is going to begin a gradual rollout of an “AI mode” option that will result in the search engine generating even more AI overviews. When search is in AI mode, Google is warning the overviews are likely to become more conversational and sometimes head down online corridors that result in falsehoods that the tech industry euphemistically calls “hallucinations.”

“As with any early-stage AI product, we won’t always get it right,” Google product vice president Robby Stein wrote in a blog post that also acknowledged the possibility “that some responses may unintentionally appear to take on a persona or reflect a particular opinion.”

More stringent guardrails are supposed to be in place to prevent AI mode from steering people in the wrong direction for queries involving health and finance.

The need for additional fine tuning is one reason Google is initially only offering AI mode in its experimental Labs section, and only subscribers to its $20-per-month Google One AI Premium will be allowed to test it out at first.

But these tests almost always result in the technology being released to all comers — a goal that Google is pursuing in response to AI-powered search engines from ChatGPT and Perplexity.

Google’s amped-up usage of more sophisticated AI overviews is likely to amplify worries that the summaries will make web surfers even less likely to click on links to take them to sites with useful information on the topic.

Those traffic referrals are one of the main ways that online publishers attract the clicks needed to sell the digital ads that help finance their operations.

Google executives insist AI overviews are still driving traffic to other sites by driving up people’s curiosity so they engage in more queries to learn more, resulting in more clicks to other publishers.

But those reassurances haven’t placated publishers who believe that Google will be the main beneficiary of AI overviews, further enriching an internet empire that already generates more than $260 billion in annual ad revenue.

The expanded use of AI overviews also could expose Google to more allegations that it is abusing the power of a search engine that a federal judge last year found to be an illegal monopoly in attempt to maintain its position as the internet’s main gateway.

The U.S. Justice Department, which filed the monopoly claims against Google in 2020, is now proposing a partial breakup of the company that would include the sale of its Chrome browser as part of its punishment. The hearings on the proposed penalties against Google, which may include digging deeper into its use of AI, are scheduled to begin next month in Washington D.C.

Online educational online service Chegg already has amplified on that monopoly case with a lawsuit filed last month in the same Washington court accusing Google of improperly cribbing information from its site to present in its AI Overviews. Google has denied the allegations.</p>
