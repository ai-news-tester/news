Ronaldinho Ga√∫cho has become a "specialist" in being the protagonist of "random roles" since his retirement from the fields.

And it won't be different this Carnival.

Now 44 years old, the idol of Barcelona and Atl√©tico-MG will be the attraction in Salvador this Saturday (1) and next Monday (3).

The former Bloco Broder Loopi has become "Bloco Broder Loopi do Bruxo" thanks to the presence of the ex-player.

Bloco that will parade in the Dod√¥ circuit (Barra-Ondina) of the Bahian capital.

And it already had a former player as "protagonist": Ed√≠lson, also a World Champion with the Brazilian National Team. He is the ambassador of the same.

‚ÄòInvej√°vel‚Äô list of random roles

The closing ceremony of the 2018 World Cup in Russia would "go unnoticed".

That's when Ronaldinho appeared "out of nowhere" calling for the spotlight.

Launched in 2018, the movie "Kickboxer - The Revenge" had some special appearances.

R10 was one of them, playing Ronaldo, a prisoner and martial arts fighter and specialist in... kicks! Mike Tyson was also part of this work.

The Turkish version of the program "No Limite" in 2021 had the presence of R10.

Who showed his talent playing footvolley with the participants.

Was anyone expecting him there? No!

How about a lesson on how to make cigars... in China!

That's what happened in November 2023.

Mais um rol√™ do Bruxo!! Hj aprendi a incr√≠vel arte de fazer charutos com meus parceiros da Ligero Pipe & Cigar House... Obrigado China!!! üá®üá≥ü§ôüèæ pic.twitter.com/xPrJhBik01 ‚Äî Ronaldinho (@10Ronaldinho) November 7, 2023

Even the COP20, the UN's annual conference on climate change, had Ronaldinho's presence.

He was invited by the government of AZERBAIJ√ÉO in the edition held in November last year in the capital Baku. He even posted photos there.

There was also, for example, the purchase of a football club in the USA, also in 2024.

Ronaldinho and his brother Assis became shareholders of the Greenville Triumph, which disputes the USL League One, equivalent to the North American Third Division.

The goal is to reach the MLS in a near future after an invitation/approval from the League.

The Greenville Triumph fell in the semifinals of the last edition of the USL League One to champion Union Omaha.
