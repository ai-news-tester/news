          <p>T-Mobile parent Deutsche Telekom is developing an “AI Phone” that would embed generative artificial intelligence (AI) systemwide as its “virtual butler.” Users would simply talk to the phone to get it to do tasks, instead of switching between apps.

“This is the future of AI innovation for consumers,” Claudia Nemat, member of the board of management for technology and innovation at Deutsche Telekom, said in a blog post. “The days of the confusing app jungle are over.”

It’s like having a “virtual butler” who “writes e-mails, starts phone calls, plays music, summarizes texts or translates them, makes calendar entries and much more,” the telecom giant said in the post.

Deutsche Telekom is using the technology from Perplexity, an AI startup that provides real-time answers through a conversational interface, similar to ChatGPT.

The Perplexity assistant will serve as the primary AI interface on the AI Phone, just like the way Siri runs systemwide in iPhones and Gemini being natively embedded in Google Pixel smartphones.

Crucially, the Perplexity assistant will be accessible from the lock screen or by double-pressing the power button, indicating a deep integration into the device’s core functionality.

According to TechCrunch, the AI Phone will be priced below $1,000. It will be unveiled later this year and start shipping in 2026. The first markets for the AI Phone will be in Europe.

Crowded AI Smartphone Market

Deutsche Telekom is introducing the AI Phone at a time of intense competition in the AI-powered devices market, with major tech companies and telecommunications providers seeking to differentiate themselves.

In January, Samsung positioned its Galaxy smartphones as “AI companions” that more deeply embed the technology into the device. Its phone can do such things as picking up on nuances in conversations and anticipating people’s needs — all based on a basket of user information it calls a “personal data engine.”

Google has continued to add AI features to its Pixel smartphones, such as Gemini Live, an AI chatbot that can engage in free-flowing conversation with the user and helps with tasks. Meanwhile, Apple reportedly might delay a long overdue upgrade to Siri.

Video, Audio and Image Capabilities

To bring additional capabilities to the AI Phone, Deutsche Telekom is partnering with Google Cloud AI, ElevenLabs and Picsart. Their services will be offered starting in the summer.

Here’s what the three partners bring to the AI phone:

Google Cloud AI adds video and audio understanding capabilities so users can do things like translate conversations in real time.

ElevenLabs can convert prompts, links and documents into multi-speaker podcasts.

Picsart lets users create their own avatars or transforms photos into different artistic styles.

          <p>David Sacks, President Donald Trump’s crypto and artificial intelligence czar, came under fire this week following allegations that he could financially benefit from Trump’s announcement of a U.S. strategic crypto reserve.

The initiative, which Trump shared details about on Sunday, would involve the government holding a reserve of digital assets, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Cardano (ADA), and Solana (SOL). Critics raised concerns that individuals within the administration with ties to these assets could stand to gain from the move.

Sacks, a venture capitalist with previous crypto investments, quickly became a focal point of the controversy. Over the weekend and into Monday, he responded on X (formerly Twitter), rejecting accusations that he had a financial interest in the policy. He stated that he had divested from all of his personal crypto-related holdings before joining the administration, including his stake in Multicoin Capital, a crypto-focused investment firm.

One lingering question, however, was whether Craft Ventures — Sacks’ venture capital firm — had retained its investment in Bitwise, a crypto index fund manager that Sacks helped fund back in 2017. Bitwise’s investment products include an ETF that holds all the assets mentioned in Trump’s strategic reserve plan, raising concerns that it could benefit from the government’s crypto purchases.

On Tuesday, a source close to Craft Ventures confirmed to CoinDesk that the fund exited its position into Bitwise prior to the start of the President's second administration. The Craft Ventures website was also updated on Tuesday to reflect that it had exited its Bitwise investment in January 2025.

Craft Ventures, Bitwise and Sacks have yet to comment publicly on the apparent exit. The source close to Craft Ventures told CoinDesk that the firm has not commented publicly so as not to disrupt Sacks' government clearance process, which is currently ongoing.

In his social media defense, Sacks dismissed the entire controversy. “The accusation that people who are already very successful in business go into government to make more money is a lazy and stupid narrative,” he wrote. “As I’ve learned, serving in government involves substantial disruption and divestiture of one’s business interests.”

The debate over Trump’s proposed reserve continues to divide the crypto community. Some of the president’s crypto supporters argue that a Bitcoin-only reserve would be preferable, while others question whether the government should be involved in digital asset holdings at all — arguing that government intervention in the crypto space contradicts the industry's decentralized ideals.

Conflict of interest questions also continue to swirl around the president, himself. The Trump-backed crypto startup World Liberty Financial has a treasury of around $500 million worth of crypto assets, including some listed in his Sunday reserve announcement.</p>
