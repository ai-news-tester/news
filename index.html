China announced on Sunday that it would accelerate the use of artificial intelligence and big data in elderly and social care, betting on new technologies to drive economic growth despite an ageing population.

The announcement comes as officials struggle with the country’s low birth rate and a declining workforce.

“We will accelerate the development and application of new technologies and products such as big data and artificial intelligence in the fields of social assistance, elderly care services, and services for the disabled,” Civil Affairs Minister Lu Zhiyuan said at a news conference during China’s annual Two Sessions political gathering.

The move aims to make services “more convenient, more accessible, and more standardised,” Lu said.

China’s population declined for the third consecutive year in 2024, with more than 310 million people aged 60 and over.

As the workforce shrinks, the government is increasingly turning to technology to drive future economic growth.

Local governments have rushed to integrate DeepSeek’s AI model into their services since the privately run Chinese company released the latest version of its chatbot in January.

DeepSeek’s budget-friendly model has outperformed many of its Western AI competitors, despite US restrictions on the sale of advanced AI chips to Chinese firms.

President Xi Jinping reaffirmed official support for the sector last month when he hosted a rare symposium for private companies, attended by several AI and technology executives. He urged them to “show their talents.”

DeepSeek’s founder, Liang Wenfeng, was present at the meeting, along with representatives from leading technology firms such as Tencent, Huawei, and Xiaomi.
