Trump administration reportedly to use AI to find Hamas-supporting foreign students to deport

JTA) — The U.S. State Department plans to use artificial intelligence to detect students from abroad who support Hamas, with the goal of canceling their visas and deporting them.

That’s according to a report Thursday from Axios, which cited unnamed department officials who said they planned to use AI to surveil the social media of students on visas. The plan is called “Catch and Revoke,” a callback to the “catch and release” approach to managing illegal immigration that Republicans have decried.

Separately, Fox News reported that the department has already revoked the visa of one student who participated in campus demonstrations against Israel amid the war in Gaza, that began which Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. The student and campus were not identified.

And the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee told NPR this week that it had heard from at least a dozen students, including some from Gaza, who were unable to reenter the country after winter break because their visas were canceled without explanation.

Together, the developments signal that the Trump administration is moving aggressively to carry out President Donald Trump’s promise not to allow international students who support terrorism to remain in the country.

“To all the resident aliens who joined in the pro-jihadist protests, we put you on notice: come 2025, we will find you, and we will deport you,” Trump said in a fact sheet that accompanied the executive order, repeating a pledge he made during his presidential campaign. “I will also quickly cancel the student visas of all Hamas sympathizers on college campuses, which have been infested with radicalism like never before.”

State Department plan to deport ‘pro-Hamas’ students relies on a 1952 law that targeted Jews “The Immigration Nationality Act of 1952 gives the secretary of state the authority to revoke visas from foreigners deemed to be a threat,” wrote Axios, citing senior State Department officials in its reporting. The 1952 law, also known as the McCarran-Walter Act, codified immigration restrictions of “subversives” and communists. The act’s quotas and ideological litmus test were widely understood at the time to target Eastern European Jewish Holocaust survivors suspected of being Soviet agents… https://forward.com/news/702427/mccarran-walter-act-state-department-plan-deport-pro-hamas-students/

These “peaceful” demonstrators have torn down and burned the American flag, while putting in its place, what can only be considered the flag of an enemy movement. It is past time for them to leave.
