          <p>LAS VEGAS – If there's one thing everyone can agree on about artificial intelligence in healthcare, it's that everyone is still unsure about how to manage its many challenges and opportunities, and just where it's all headed.

It's a huge and complex and sometimes mysterious topic that's still new to a lot of people. It's transformative, and it's moving faster and evolving by the day.

"We're all gonna feel a little stupid sometimes if we wanna get this right," said HIMSS25 AI in Healthcare Forum co-emcee Brian Spisak on Monday morning.

Health system leaders are seeking insights and clarity as they chart strategies to use AI to optimize their financial and operational processes, create value, reduce documentation burden and streamline workflows – and ultimately to improve patient outcomes and enable value-based care.

They're also grappling with the challenges: How to ensure transparency, explainability and equity of models and their outputs. How to protect patient safety as AI is applied in clinical settings. How to manage very real workforce ramifications.

In his opening keynote, "AI Policy Considerations and Practical Adoption Strategies for Transformative Technologies," Dennis Chornenky, chief AI advisor at UC Davis Health, explored those topics and more.

Chornenky – read our recent two-part profile of him – pointed to a future where artificial intelligence has changed more about the day-to-day work of healthcare delivery than many might be expecting, even in these heady days of hope and hype.

As humans, "our minds are wired to be able to predict incremental change pretty well," he said. "What we're not very good at predicting is change that tends to jump forward a little bit more quickly: exponential change, or change by orders of magnitude.

"The environment we're in right now is one where AI's capabilities and potential impact really are advancing at an exponential rate," he said. "Over the next several years, we can expect, probably each of the years ahead, for AI's cognitive reasoning capabilities to jump by not 10 times, but more like 100 times with each iterative cycle."

We've spent most of the past two years talking about, implementing and exploring the possibilities of large language models and generative AI. Now, in 2025, agentic AI is the next frontier for healthcare.

"This is an iteration forward that leverages large language models, but also adds a lot of other methodologies to address workflows."

The most succinct description of the difference between the two? GenAI can create content, but agentic AI can take action – even learning and setting goals.

"You can almost think of it like what we used to talk about as robotic process automation, or RPA, combined with AI – and what the various opportunities are," said Chornenky.

The opportunities for increased efficiencies are enormous, he said. But so are the potential risks to the sorts of jobs many people in healthcare have gotten pretty used to performing for themselves in recent years.

As "intelligent automation" transforms work processes, with AI becoming "multimodal, both in terms of ingestion of data, but also output," many use cases that once depended on many steps to accomplish, or the input and expertise of several different people, will be accomplished with a single prompt.

"That begs the question of what happens to people in junior roles and [their] intellectual work?" asked Chornenky. "PowerPoint decks, research reports, and things like that. If all of that can be automated, how do future generations, our children, get access to more junior-level jobs in order to get experience to get to senior-level jobs?"

His prediction: "I think our kids are going to have to get very good at managing AI. They're going to have to be able to say, 'Hey, I can effectively manage 10 AI agents.' That sounds like a stronger value proposition to an employer, I think, than just saying, 'Hey, I'm just a human, and I'm smart.

"That is the reality that we're going to," he added. "It's a little scary, but something we have to think about. So teach your kids how to use ChatGPT effectively now."

And agentic AI is only the next step. After that, as many predict, will come AGI, or artificial general intelligence.

"If an agentic AI can start to fully replace jobs, we can think of AGI as a higher-order intelligence that can perhaps even start to replace the management of entire enterprises," said Chornenky.

"Imagine a higher-order intelligence that can manage 100 AI agents that really doesn't require a lot of human supervision. Maybe there's a human board of directors, maybe there's some human technicians helping to run all the systems, but the majority of the productivity of that enterprise is being done by AI. Do we continue to regulate those enterprises in the same ways that we have in the past?"

And that's not even touching the cybersecurity implications.

"We'll be using AI to test for vulnerabilities on our own systems. But you can imagine an arms race where AIs are going at it?"

Healthcare organizations need to create a new governance and adoption infrastructure for autonomous AI, "because these capabilities are just getting more and more powerful," said Chornenky. "Without the right adoption infrastructure, regulated sectors are going to find it very difficult to adopt these more powerful technologies, whether it's healthcare or government."

That "AI governance gap," with innovation happening too rapidly for regulations and regulators to keep up, could prevent healthcare organizations from adopting AI more quickly.

That creates a dilemma for CIOs too, "because they're under pressure to adopt the new tech from their boards, from their partners and from patients, I think, to a growing extent. But they've got to ensure safety. And how do they do that if they don't have the proper governance mechanisms set up?"

Those are all questions that will have to be answered in the future. And that future may arrive more quickly than many expect.

In the meantime, it's essential for healthcare workers to get more comfortable and familiar with AI. Because there will be impacts on the job market as the benefits of automating certain tasks and roles become harder to look past.

Echoing a common refrain of the AI age, Chornenky said it is not, in the near team, "going to replace managers. But it is going to replace managers who don't use AI."

        <div class="card card-body">
          <p>BMO Financial Group, one of the largest banks in North America with $1.4 trillion in total assets, is getting ready to reap the benefits of quantum computing by the end of the year.

That’s according to Kristin Milchanowski, BMO’s chief artificial intelligence (AI) and data officer.

Last month, BMO — the parent of BMO Capital and BMO Wealth Management — joined the IBM Quantum Network to gain access to its advanced quantum infrastructure.

This would enable BMO to develop and deploy quantum-powered solutions across its operations, such as new approaches to optimize investment portfolio strategies and reveal deep insights into risk management.

“We are in quantum because we do believe that it holds transformational potential,” Milchanowski said in an interview with PYMNTS. “It’s really about preparedness and … getting the muscle memory in place so that we can have first-mover advantage.”

While not ready for prime time, quantum computing nevertheless has hit a turning point. In the past two years, quantum computing has reached a state of utility, she said. That’s the point where it can provide useful results for certain problems, even though it is not yet more broadly useful than today’s standard “classical” computers.

“I can run algorithms and use cases inside a quantum environment and get a useful result — and that’s a significant foot forward,” Milchanowski said.

BMO chose the IBM network because the tech company has “never missed a milestone on their published roadmap, and I really do believe by the end of the calendar year, they will have enough compute power in their quantum machine for me to run really useful algorithms,” she said.

Last year, Fast Company listed BMO as among the world’s most innovative companies in the personal finance category. Also, the company was named the ninth most innovative company in the Innovation in Banking Index by Evident AI. Helping its ranking was placing third in AI-related patents: BMO said its patents were 2.4 times more likely to have forward citations per patent, which is a measure of a patent’s value and impact.

Focus on AI Agents

Milchanowski said BMO takes a digital-first strategy in its operations. But when it comes to generative AI, the current form is not scalable for corporations.

“It’s limited and doesn’t scale well in corporate. So that’s why you’re seeing a lot of the hype being busted in the news lately, just because it really doesn’t scale in the version that it’s in today,” Milchanowski said. “But it will add reasoning soon, and that next generation of generative AI will be more useful.”

Generative AI carries high computational costs — even though fees have been coming down — suffers from data and compliance issues, and still hallucinates.

According to OpenAI, its most accurate model GPT-4.5 is only 62.5% factually accurate on average, based on the SimpleQA Accuracy benchmark. GPT-4o, OpenAI o1 and OpenAI o3-mini scored far lower, at 38.2%, 47% and 15% on average.

At present, Milchanowski is focusing on AI agents — bots that do tasks for the user without constant human supervision — in the following areas:

Chatbot to help customers understand their portfolios more intimately.

AI agent in the area of pricing and risk management for BMO’s capital markets team. It gathers data from various pricing models, reasons and then a human employee asks the agent to take action. The agent learns from feedback and its own experience.

Rover AI, a digital assistant, for streamlining the field underwriting process in BMO’s individual life insurance business.

AI analysis of customer call transcripts to identify pain points and improve communication.

AI used for automating internal compliance processes, ensuring accuracy and efficiency in customer interactions.

Longstanding AI tools include BMO’s CashTrack Insight, which predicts potential cash shortfalls, such as an account balance dropping below zero, up to seven days in advance. It looks at patterns in spending, regular payments, and income to make these predictions.

Another is the AI-powered BMO Savings Amplifier that lets customers open new savings accounts, set personalized goals, establish automated transfers, and monitor their progress. It uses AI from Personetics to analyze financial data in real time to understand customer behavior, anticipate needs and deliver a personalized experience.

What’s Next

But Milchanowski said these agents have limited autonomy, given the regulatory restrictions in the financial services industry. The agents need human input and they are specifically trained for certain tasks.

“We’re really focused right now on the AI agents, because in banking … everything we do needs to be governed. We do it responsibly, and we want to have a human in the loop,” Milchanowski said. “So these AI agents are really great for us. We’re wanting to introduce them into a more broad customer support function, but we have to be really careful.”

Milchanowski said BMO is working on an AI tool that can deliver a hyper-personalized experience to clients to do things such as adjust financial advice or investment strategies based on real-time market information.

Notably, the bank’s AI efforts are overseen by its governance committee to ensure they are deployed responsibly, Milchanowski said.

Advice to Business Leaders

When unleashing digital transformation with AI, Milchanowski has this advice to business leaders:

Become a steward of understanding innovation, what great companies do to innovate and what are their key tenets. It’s important to adopt an innovative mindset. Eliminate an outdated business process at least once a month, because then it’s easier to implement new technology. Be bold in an era of exponential technological change.</p>

          <p>Anthropic raised $3.5 billion in a Series E funding round to expand its artificial intelligence offerings.

“With this investment, Anthropic will advance its development of next-generation AI systems, expand its compute capacity, deepen its research in mechanistic interpretability and alignment, and accelerate its international expansion,” the company said in a Monday (March 3) press release.

The round gave Anthropic a post-money valuation of $61.5 billion, according to the release.

The announcement of the funding round follows the company’s launch of Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Claude Code, the release said.

Anthropic plans to make further progress in its AI systems’ coding abilities and is focused on developing systems that “can serve as true collaborators, working alongside teams to tackle complex projects, synthesize information across fields, and help organizations achieve outsized impact,” according to the release.

Businesses have integrated Claude to perform tasks like turning natural language into code, assisting tax professionals, accelerating the writing of clinical study reports, and helping power Amazon’s Alexa+ to bring AI capabilities to households, per the release.

It was reported Sunday (March 2) that Amazon, which is one of the top investors in Anthropic, said that both companies’ AI models are excellent and that Amazon’s in-house AI model, Nova, handled over 70% of customers’ conversations with the new Alexa.

In the Monday press release, after highlighting the ways businesses have integrated Claude, Anthropic said: “Continuing this trajectory, Anthropic remains focused on deepening our understanding of frontier AI systems and ensuring that artificial intelligence advances human progress.”

It was reported Feb. 24 that Anthropic was finalizing a $3.5 billion funding round after having an initial goal of $2 billion but then convincing investors to raise their investments during discussions.

PYMNTS reported Feb. 12, amid rumors of Anthropic’s talks to raise money, that OpenAI only raised 31% more than Anthropic at the time even though OpenAI drew 51 times more traffic for ChatGPT than Anthropic did for Claude.

On Feb. 13, Anthropic said that across industries, around 36% of occupations use AI for at least a quarter of their tasks while 4% use it for three-quarters of their tasks.
