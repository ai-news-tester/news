          <p>According to a new study from Modl.ai, 30% of game developers believe that artificial intelligence will play an "extremely important" role in QA processes.

Conducted in September 2024, the Danish AI firm surveyed 303 US-based game developers across various departments including QA, production, art, programming, game and level design, audio, and studio leadership.

Of those surveyed, 94% think that AI had already been incorporated into their studios to support processes such as test scripts, automated bug reporting, and playtesting automation.

The report suggested that the use of AI for "repetitive, tedious, and data-heavy tasks" could allow developers to focus on "creative and exploratory" QA work where "human involvement really makes a difference."

This is particularly pertinent as 77% of respondents said they felt as though they conducted "less QA than they should have" due to time and resource constraints.

Nearly half of those surveyed said that AI was most useful for faster bug detection, as well as automated bug reporting and 24/7 testing capabilities.

As for the cost-effectiveness of AI in QA, 15% said it was "very cost effective" followed by 40% believing it was "somewhat cost effective" and 34% remaining neutral on the subject.

However, skepticism remains around using AI in QA processes, with the majority of developers citing "lack of human intuition" as their main concern alongside a "potential for inaccuracies" and "inconsistent results."

"AI complements human expertise; it doesn't replace it," said Modl.ai CEO and co-founder Christoffer Holmgård.

"QA processes are an integral part of game development, so as you start using AI, the tools will have to focus on human-AI collaboration. Developers must consider their concrete workflows and where the AI tools fit."</p>

Wearable gadgets like smart watches and glasses are growing more capable every year, but experts say smartphones will remain ubiquitous for the foreseeable future — not least thanks to artificial intelligence features.

A slew of wearable products and prototypes were on show at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona Monday, even as smartphone makers and network operators played up AI integration as making handsets more useful.

Such “new product ranges allow manufacturers to diversify the hopes until now placed in phones” said Cesar Corcoles, an IT and telecoms professor at the Open University of Catalonia.

The trade show in Barcelona will see “prototypes and demonstrations of smart glasses that place a small, very limited screen in front of our eyes”.

Smart glasses have seemed on the horizon for more than a decade, with Google’s Glass headset and camera released in 2013 — although it has since been discontinued.

Meta has encountered more success recently with its frames developed alongside Ray-Ban, offering features including a built-in camera, music playback and voice interactions with the company’s AI.

Yann LeCun, star AI researcher at the company which owns Facebook and Instagram, is often seen showing off the glasses at public appearances.

Worldwide, the market for smart glasses appears to be surging in terms of unit sales, with a 210-percent year-on-year increase in 2024 according to specialist research firm Counterpoint — far faster than the seven-percent growth in smartphone shipments calculated by analysts Canalys.

– ‘Cool gimmick’ for now –

But comparing the number of devices rather than growth rates, last year’s roughly two million pairs of smart glasses barely register compared to the 1.2 billion smartphones sold.

Counterpoint predicts the glasses market will grow further in the coming years as more producers — from social media giants to smartphone makers — look to claim a piece of the action.

Other wearable categories may need longer to take off, with the recent shutdown of “AI Pin” maker Humane a sign some wearable tech is not yet mature.

Designed to be worn at chest level like a brooch, the would-be smartphone replacement incorporating a camera and mini projector was designed to be used via AI-powered voice interactions but received poor reviews.

Humane has now been sold to HP after the device failed to make the hoped-for impact.

The “AI Pin” was “just not that useful yet”, Canalys expert Jack Leathem said.

Voice-controlled devices are “a cool gimmick, but humans have become very, very used to text-based interactions on touchscreens,” he added — habits it would take a powerful sales pitch to change.

“The most challenging thing is getting people to change their behaviour,” agreed Shen Ye of smartphone maker HTC’s Vive wearables arm.

“We still use a QWERTY keyboard because it’s what we’re used to… even though there are probably much better ways of typing,” he added.

– AI on your phone –

Beyond consumer inertia, wearable tech is still up against engineering challenges stemming from its bid to squeeze smartphone-like functionality into a smaller package.

“There are limits around the computing power currently and battery performance,” Leathem said. “You can’t make them that compact.”

That’s one reason why smart watches able to make calls and send messages largely remain tethered to wearers’ smartphones for now.

“Every smart watch that comes out now is there to interact with a smartphone, not to replace it. It’s an accessory,” Leathem said.

What’s more, manufacturers are incentivised to get consumers buying a wider range of gadgets rather than simply swapping one for another.

And even as wearables become more useful, AI is expected to pump more value into smartphones themselves.

The latest offerings from Apple, Samsung or China’s Xiaomi have bet on offering users integrated “AI assistant” features.

“All the money is going into AI… their vision of the future is keeping the same smartphone form factor, but making it way more useful,” Leathem said.

Canalys predicts that the share of smartphones sold worldwide with AI features will leap from 16 percent at present to more than half by 2028.</p>

          <p>Investor excitement over generative artificial intelligence continues to center on the installation of graphics-processing units (GPU) and related equipment by data centers, which support their corporate clients’ efforts to develop the new technology. Nvidia Corp. NVDA continues to dominate that market. But a long-term investor might be well served to think about what companies will actually do with the technology.

Nicole Kornitzer has been the portfolio manager for the Buffalo International Fund BUFIX since 2009. She is based in Paris, although Kornitzer Capital Management, which manages the Buffalo Funds, is based in Mission, Kan. Kornitzer Capital Management has about $7 billion in assets under management through mutual funds and for institutional and private clients. The firm was founded by John Kornitzer, Nicole’s father, in 1989.</p>
