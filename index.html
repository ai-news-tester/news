          <p>Many exhibitors at the MWC hail from China, and will thus be paying additional tariffs in the United States

By Mona GUICHARD, Valentin BONTEMPS and Tom BARFIELD

Frantic optimism about artificial intelligence's potential to empower gadgets is set to clash with fears about trade tensions stoked by the White House at this week's Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona.

The annual gathering for smartphone makers, telecom operators and other connected-services providers is set to draw around 100,000 attendees to the Spanish Mediterranean port city, the day before fresh American tariffs come into force on Chinese goods.

Many exhibitors at the MWC hail from China, and will thus be paying an additional 10-percent levy to import into the United States on top of the 10 percent already imposed by Trump since he took office in January.

The billionaire president is also pushing neighbors Mexico and Canada to follow suit.

Higher costs for trade could impact the entire global tech and smartphone market if Trump keeps the China tariffs in place and extends them to other major economies like the European Union, as he has threatened.

"We expect the current geopolitical situation... to be a hot topic of conversation" at MWC, said Ben Wood, research director at CCS Insight, pointing to "ongoing uncertainty around U.S. tariffs and sanctions".

Many of the most important components for tech gadgets including vital semiconductors are manufactured in China.

"Nobody really knows what's going to happen" on trade, said Pekka Lundmark, CEO of major network hardware maker Nokia, at a pre-MWC event late Sunday.

"Obviously a global tariff war would not be to anyone's benefit," Lundmark added, saying that his company was "calculating different alternatives based on the scenarios that we have seen" for US trade policy.

On Sunday, some of the many Chinese smartphone makers set to attend MWC alongside other global telecom heavyweights focused their pre-show announcements on new products and investments.

Manufacturer Honor -- a spinoff from tech behemoth Huawei -- said it was launching a new phase in its development that would transform it into "a global leading AI device ecosystem company".

Future "intelligent" smartphones would come equipped with AI "agents", developed in partnership with American firms Google Cloud and Qualcomm, who are able to take on tasks like scheduling events or reserving a table at a restaurant, Honor said.

Competitor Xiaomi for its part unveiled a new range of smartphones equipped with high-quality cameras and their own suite of AI features.

Generative artificial intelligence's capture of tech industry attention since ChatGPT first emerged has made it a must-have for any firm developing new devices.

"AI will be an omnipresent topic at MWC, but industry watchers are experiencing a growing AI fatigue," Wood said.

"Although AI is now the cornerstone for most product announcements...it is often hard to understand the tangible benefits" for people actually using devices, he pointed out.

"Agent" services like those shown off by Honor are one attempt to make consumers understand what they can use AI on their phones for.

Such hurdles have not kept a lid on smartphone sales, which recovered from two years of shrinkage to expand 6.3 percent in 2024 -- topping 1.2 billion units according to market intelligence firm IDC.

Manufacturers are optimistic about maintaining the momentum into this year.

"The strong growth witnessed in 2024 proves the resilience of the smartphone market," IDC research director Nabila Popal said.

Sales growth had defied "lingering macro challenges, forex concerns in emerging markets, ongoing inflation, and lukewarm demand", she underlined.

Wearable gadgets like smart watches and glasses are growing more capable every year, but experts say smartphones will remain ubiquitous for the foreseeable future -- not least thanks to artificial intelligence features.

A slew of wearable products and prototypes were on show at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona Monday, even as smartphone makers and network operators played up AI integration as making handsets more useful.

Such "new product ranges allow manufacturers to diversify the hopes until now placed in phones" said Cesar Corcoles, an IT and telecoms professor at the Open University of Catalonia.

The trade show in Barcelona will see "prototypes and demonstrations of smart glasses that place a small, very limited screen in front of our eyes".

Smart glasses have seemed on the horizon for more than a decade, with Google's Glass headset and camera released in 2013 -- although it has since been discontinued.

Meta has encountered more success recently with its frames developed alongside Ray-Ban, offering features including a built-in camera, music playback and voice interactions with the company's AI.

Yann LeCun, star AI researcher at the company which owns Facebook and Instagram, is often seen showing off the glasses at public appearances.

Worldwide, the market for smart glasses appears to be surging in terms of unit sales, with a 210-percent year-on-year increase in 2024 according to specialist research firm Counterpoint -- far faster than the seven-percent growth in smartphone shipments calculated by analysts Canalys.

But comparing the number of devices rather than growth rates, last year's roughly two million pairs of smart glasses barely register compared to the 1.2 billion smartphones sold.

Counterpoint predicts the glasses market will grow further in the coming years as more producers -- from social media giants to smartphone makers -- look to claim a piece of the action.

Other wearable categories may need longer to take off, with the recent shutdown of "AI Pin" maker Humane a sign some wearable tech is not yet mature.

Designed to be worn at chest level like a brooch, the would-be smartphone replacement incorporating a camera and mini projector was designed to be used via AI-powered voice interactions but received poor reviews.

Humane has now been sold to HP after the device failed to make the hoped-for impact.

The "AI Pin" was "just not that useful yet", Canalys expert Jack Leathem said.

Voice-controlled devices are "a cool gimmick, but humans have become very, very used to text-based interactions on touchscreens," he added -- habits it would take a powerful sales pitch to change.

"The most challenging thing is getting people to change their behaviour," agreed Shen Ye of smartphone maker HTC's Vive wearables arm.

"We still use a QWERTY keyboard because it's what we're used to... even though there are probably much better ways of typing," he added.

Beyond consumer inertia, wearable tech is still up against engineering challenges stemming from its bid to squeeze smartphone-like functionality into a smaller package.

"There are limits around the computing power currently and battery performance," Leathem said. "You can't make them that compact."

That's one reason why smart watches able to make calls and send messages largely remain tethered to wearers' smartphones for now.

"Every smart watch that comes out now is there to interact with a smartphone, not to replace it. It's an accessory," Leathem said.

What's more, manufacturers are incentivised to get consumers buying a wider range of gadgets rather than simply swapping one for another.

And even as wearables become more useful, AI is expected to pump more value into smartphones themselves.

The latest offerings from Apple, Samsung or China's Xiaomi have bet on offering users integrated "AI assistant" features.

"All the money is going into AI... their vision of the future is keeping the same smartphone form factor, but making it way more useful," Leathem said.

Canalys predicts that the share of smartphones sold worldwide with AI features will leap from 16 percent at present to more than half by 2028.

          <p>High school shop classes are back in a big way as students and educators prepare for a future in which AI could take over many of what we today think of as "white-collar" jobs.

As the Wall Street Journal reports, school systems across the United States are building out new curricula for shop classes that merge old-school skills like woodworking and welding with higher-tech instruction on how to operate automated machinery.

After Wisconsin's Middleton High School spent $90 million updating its facilities to include a high-tech new manufacturing lab — which features a fishbowl-style window to watch computer-controlled robot arms build things — interest in the state-of-the-art shop classes began to rise.

Quincy Millerjohn, an English teacher-turned-welding instructor at the Madison-area school, told the newspaper that he began showing students union pay scales for ironworkers and boilermakers that ranged from $41 to $52 an hour. In recent years, roughly a quarter of Middleton's 2,300 students have taken at least one of the school's classes in construction, manufacturing, or woodworking — a massive proportion, especially considering that many school systems eradicated shop classes in the 1990s and the 2000s.

"We want kids going to college to feel these courses fit on their transcripts along with AP and honors," Millerjohn, a former English teacher, said. "Kids can see these aren’t knuckle-dragging jobs."

Though shop classes have been experiencing something of a renaissance for years now amid increasingly unaffordable college tuitions, concerns about AI replacing office jobs seem to have led to even greater interest among America's next generation of laborers.

"There’s a paradigm shift happening," explained Jake Mihm, an education consultant with Wisconsin's Department of Public Instruction who in the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction. "[Manual labor positions] are high-skill, high-wage jobs that are attractive to people because they’re hands-on, and heads-on."

The same year that Middleton overhauled its shop class facilities, the Houston-area Spring Branch Independent School District successfully passed a $381.6 million bond proposal to fund so-called career technical education (CTE) facilities at its schools. According to that system's superintendent, Jennifer Blaine, vocational training enrollment has risen 9 percent over the past four years.

"Not everybody wants to go to college," Blaine told the WSJ, "and some people don’t want to go to college right away."

It's true that AI is poised to radically change the face of education and labor — but we've got to admit, we didn't expect it to result in the return of shop class.
