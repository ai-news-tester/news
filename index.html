Amazon is testing artificial intelligence-aided dubbing for select movies and shows offered on its Prime streaming service.

The company said this week that the AI-assisted dubbing – which refers to the practice of replacing an original audio track with a translated language – will be offered for licensed titles that previously lacked dubbing, such as the 2003 animated film “El Cid: La Leyenda.”

The Seattle-based company said its AI-aided dubbing service will be in English and Latin American Spanish. Initially, it will be offered for 12 licensed titles.

Amazon says the program will take a hybrid approach, allowing “local processionals to collaborate with AI to ensure quality control.”

Other tech companies have also introduced AI-powered dubbing into their platforms. Last year, YouTube released a feature that allows content creators to translate their videos into multiple languages. Meta, meanwhile, said in September that it was testing an AI tool that will automatically translate voices in Reels.</p>

          <p>Dublin, March 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Artificial Intelligence and Analytics in Surgery - Global Strategic Business Report" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.



The global market for Artificial Intelligence and Analytics in Surgery was valued at US$255.3 Million in 2024 and is projected to reach US$950.8 Million by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 24.5% from 2024 to 2030. This comprehensive report provides an in-depth analysis of market trends, drivers, and forecasts, helping you make informed business decisions.



Artificial Intelligence (AI) and analytics are revolutionizing the field of surgery, making procedures more precise, efficient, and safer. Advanced AI algorithms are being employed to analyze complex patient data, enabling surgeons to make well-informed decisions before, during, and after surgeries. Preoperative planning has seen significant advancements, as AI-powered systems provide detailed simulations and predictive models to optimize surgical approaches. These tools reduce errors and enhance patient outcomes by tailoring procedures to individual needs.





The growth in the Artificial Intelligence and Analytics in Surgery market is driven by several key factors, reflecting the increasing integration of these technologies into surgical practices. Rapid advancements in AI algorithms, coupled with the availability of high-resolution imaging and real-time analytics, are enabling more precise and effective surgical interventions. The rising prevalence of complex diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disorders is also driving demand for advanced surgical solutions, where AI and analytics play a pivotal role in improving outcomes.



Consumer expectations for personalized and minimally invasive procedures are pushing healthcare providers to adopt cutting-edge technologies. AI-driven preoperative planning tools and robotic assistance systems are meeting these demands by enhancing precision and reducing recovery times. Furthermore, the growing emphasis on data-driven healthcare and regulatory requirements for patient safety are encouraging the integration of analytics into surgical workflows. These technologies are proving indispensable for improving operational efficiency, enhancing patient care, and addressing the evolving needs of the healthcare sector. As innovation continues to advance, AI and analytics are poised to play an even greater role in shaping the future of surgery.



What Is Driving AI and Analytics Adoption in Surgery?



The growing adoption of AI and analytics in surgery is fueled by advancements in technology and an increasing demand for improved patient outcomes. AI-enabled surgical robots are becoming more sophisticated, allowing for minimally invasive procedures that result in shorter recovery times and reduced hospital stays. These systems integrate seamlessly with advanced imaging technologies, providing surgeons with a comprehensive view of the surgical field. This is particularly valuable in complex surgeries such as neurosurgery and oncology, where precision is critical.



The shift toward value-based healthcare is also a significant driver. Hospitals and surgical centers are under pressure to improve efficiency and reduce costs without compromising care quality. AI and analytics help optimize resource allocation, streamline workflows, and enhance surgical team coordination. Furthermore, advancements in natural language processing and voice-activated systems are simplifying documentation processes, enabling surgeons to focus more on patient care. These factors collectively underscore the growing reliance on AI and analytics to meet the demands of modern surgical environments.



Can AI and Analytics Address Challenges in Postoperative Care?



Postoperative care is a critical aspect of surgical success, and AI is playing an increasingly vital role in this phase. AI-driven predictive models analyze patient data to forecast recovery trajectories and identify potential risks, such as infections or complications. This allows healthcare providers to intervene proactively, reducing readmission rates and improving long-term outcomes. AI-powered monitoring systems can track patients' vital signs remotely, providing real-time updates to clinicians and enabling early detection of any abnormalities.



Analytics also contribute to improving patient engagement and adherence to postoperative care plans. By personalizing recovery recommendations based on patient-specific data, healthcare providers can ensure better compliance and quicker recoveries. Additionally, AI is being used to analyze large datasets from past surgeries, identifying trends and best practices that inform evidence-based improvements in postoperative protocols. These technologies are not only enhancing recovery experiences but also contributing to broader improvements in surgical care standards.
