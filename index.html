          <p>Alibaba shares surged 7% after the company open-sourced its QwQ-32B AI model.

The model competes with DeepSeek's R1, and the company says it is more energy- and cost-efficient.

Alibaba's shares have risen close to 70% this year amid a Chinese tech stock rally.

Alibaba surged on Thursday after the company made one of its artificial intelligence models public, a sign that the party isn't over for Chinese tech stocks.

The e-commerce giant's Hong Kong shares jumped as much as 7.5% in Hong Kong after it made its QwQ-32B model public. Alibaba said that the model competes with DeepSeek's R1 — the AI startup's newest flagship model — in terms of performance while being more energy- and cost-efficient.

Alibaba's shares in Hong Kong and its secondary listing in New York are up close to 70% so far this year. The company is worth $317.7 billion, much smaller than its US counterparts like Amazon, which has a market capitalization of $2.16 trillion.

Last month, Alibaba's shares rose after a report said the company was working with Apple to roll out AI features for iPhones in China, news the companies later confirmed. The stock also jumped on news that Chinese leader Xi Jinping was meeting with the country's tech moguls.

The share performance is part of a DeepSeek-propelled stock rally for Chinese tech firms, which are making a comeback after Beijing's yearslong crackdown on Big Tech. Investors saw Xi's meeting with tech leaders, including Alibaba founder Jack Ma, Tencent CEO Pony Ma, and electric vehicle maker BYD CEO Wang Chuanfu, as a sign he wants to revive the sector.

Early last week, Alibaba announced plans to invest at least 380 billion Chinese yuan, or $53 billion, in cloud computing and AI infrastructure over the next three years. How much Big Tech companies are spending — part of their capital expenditure — is a hot topic, as some companies double down on AI-related investments.

"DeepSeek is driving Cloud capex in China," HSBC analyst Frank He wrote in a note last week. "We see that individual user demand has been growing, and the AI model has been increasingly deployed by enterprises and government entities."

Last month, Goldman Sachs analysts said that DeepSeek R-1 has "altered the narrative" of China tech. They added that the recent rally appears to be more sustainable compared to a September stimulus-driven spike that fizzled out in weeks because it is "innovation-driven."

On Thursday, Alibaba said its QwQ-32B model has one-fifth of the parameters compared to DeepSeek-R1, which means it is highly efficient. The model is now open-source on platforms including Hugging Face. Open-source models allow for the free and open sharing of software to anyone for any purpose.

DeepSeek launched an open-sourced AI model in January, rattling US tech and AI companies . Third-party tests showed the model outperformed its peers from OpenAI, Meta, and other top developers, and the company said it was built for less money.

The company didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.</p>

          <p>Google Search received a new artificial intelligence (AI) feature dubbed AI Mode on Wednesday. The Mountain View-based tech giant was reportedly internally testing this feature last month, and has now rolled it out to a limited number of users. The AI Mode will offer responses on complex topics, and search queries that are multi-faceted and would normally take a user multiple searches to find the information. Additionally, the company is also upgrading AI Overviews with the Gemini 2.0 model. The new version of the feature is currently only available in the US.

Google Search Gets AI Mode

In a blog post, the tech giant detailed the new AI Mode for Google Search. This new interface is said to offer “more advanced reasoning, thinking and multimodal capabilities,” and will act as an expansion to the existing AI Overviews.

Currently, the AI Mode is available to select users via Google Labs as an early experiment. The company also said that it will begin inviting Google One AI Premium subscribers to try out the experience in Labs. There is no word on if or when it will roll out to regular Google Search users.

After opting in for the AI Mode experience, eligible users will see the feature as a filter on the search results page. AI Mode is placed in the first position, followed by All, Images, News, Maps, and more. So, after a user runs a search query normally on Google, they will be able to switch to the new mode by tapping the filter.

Google said that the AI Mode is powered by a custom Gemini 2.0 model and is useful for queries that require deeper exploration, comparisons, or reasoning. It allows users to ask follow-up questions, and shows multimodal results including images, tables, and more. It also lists websites that can help the user get additional information.

The AI tool uses a “query fan-out” technique to run multiple related searches simultaneously across sub-topics, and looks through several data sources to provide a comprehensive result in an “easy-to-understand format,” the company said. Some of the data sources used by the AI Mode include web content, knowledge graph, shopping data, and general information about the real world.

As per the company, AI Mode is equipped with novel approaches to improve the factuality of the responses. However, Google acknowledged that there is a possibility that some responses could reflect a particular opinion. Those with access to the feature can provide feedback and help the company improve the tool. Additionally, the tech giant highlighted that AI Mode will only show web search results in areas where it does not have a high confidence in helpfulness and quality.

AI Overviews Upgraded With New AI Model

Google is also updating its AI Overviews feature in Search, which offers a snapshot summary of search results. It will now be powered by Gemini 2.0, and can now answer more complex questions around coding, advanced mathematics, as well as multimodal queries. This new version of AI Overviews is currently available in the US.

Additionally, the company is also expanding the product to more users. AI Overviews will also be available to teenagers (using a teen account). These AI-generated summaries will also show up for users who are not signed into their Google accounts.</p>
